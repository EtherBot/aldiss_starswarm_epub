  <p class="block_15">SECTOR VIOLET</p>
 <p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:center; widows:0"><a id="soldier"></a>
  <br>

  <p class="block_21">This episode concerns the will in man to preserve that which he finds beautiful and rare. As it happens, it also provides — but this indirectly — an illustration of what chance can do to our metabolisms.</p>

  <p class="block_22">What it does not concern itself with is the working of chance itself, and when and whether chance is really something with a darker name — Fate. Certainly there is a sense in which the fates of the two humans from Sector Violet, whom we shall meet presently, were sealed a million years before they were born. But in the same way, all our fates are decided to a great extent by the worlds to which we are born. Whether fate comes to mean a way of life or a way of death depends on the planet; whether we are blessed or cursed is a matter of environment.</p>

  <p class="block_22">As planetary beings, we are peculiarly aware of this principle. However we define man, we cannot define him in isolation, apart from his milieu. The warring telesensual races of the Alpha Wheel fully convince us of that.</p>

  <p class="block_22">This is a misfortune when the environment happens to be a hostile planet on which mankind is ill-equipped to survive.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Some planets are sunk too far into antiquity to support man. Though other factors seem congenial, the biosphere wears down, the soil dies, the inorganic conquers. Abrogun is on its way to becoming such a world.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Other planets may be too unripe to support mankind. Such is Istinogurzibeshilaha, the world on which the two we are about to meet were born.</p>

  <p class="block_22">If unripe planets can bear only unripe personalities, what sort of duties do the privileged owe them?</p>

    <br/>
  <br>
<br/>
  <br>

  <p class="block_16">The announcement that trickled from a thousand speech glands was as gentle as if it bubbled through liquid.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The first party to disembark will be the immigrant intake from Istinogurzibeshilaha. Will the immigrant intake from Istinogurzibeshilaha please assemble at their deck exit for departure to the Dansson Immunization Center as soon as possible. Your luggage will be unloaded later. Your luggage will be unloaded later."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The man with the slow pulse in his throat lay on his bunk and listened to the repetition of this speech without raising the lashless lids of his eyes. The luxurious voice brought him back from a region far beyond the grave, where shapeless things walked among blue shadows. When he had reoriented himself, he allowed his eyes to open.</p>

  <p class="block_17">His mate Corbis huddled on the floor by the door, trembling.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He sat up slowly, for the temperature in their cabin was still too low for activity. But she was less torpid than he, and came over to him to put an arm round his shoulders before he was properly sitting up. She rested the edge of her mouth against his.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm afraid, Saton," she said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The words raised no rational response from him, though they conjured up a memory of the proddings of fright he had experienced walking through the tall wooden forests of his native planet.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We've arrived, Saton. This is Dansson at last, and they i want us to disembark. Now I'm terribly afraid. I've been i afraid ever since I came out of light-freeze. They promised us a proper revival temperature, but the temperature in here is only ten degrees. They know we are no good when it isn't warm enough."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saton's mind was unstirred by her alarm. He huddled on the bunk, not moving except to blink his eyes.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Suppose Dansson isn't the haven we were led to think it is," she said. "It couldn't be a trick of some sort, could it? I mean, suppose all those tests and examinations we passed on Istinogurzibeshilaha were just a bait to get us here. . . . Oh, we hear that Dansson is so marvelous, but did we ever hear of one person who ever returned from Dansson? If they had some awful fate in store for us, we—why, we'd be completely helpless."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She listened to the tramp of strange feet in the corridor beyond their door. She too had had her frightening dreams during the long interstellar journey.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She had seen that time when her mother was a little girl, forty years ago, and the humans who roamed the galaxy at will had first arrived and found her people in their wooden villages, dotted about those few zones of Istinogurzibeshilaha that would support life. In her dreams humans had been taller</p>

  <p class="block_17">than the sad sequoias, and had brought not benefits and wonders but gigantic metal cages and coffins. She had woken with the clang of steel doors about her ears.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We shouldn't have come, Saton," she said. "I'm afraid. Let's not stay on Dansson."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The pulse came and went in his throat, and he said, "Dansson is one of the capital planets of the universe."</p>

  <p class="block_17">It was the first fact that drifted into his chilled mind. His system was functioning too slowly to respond to her, and by the same token he suspected that her mind was not working properly, was simply responding to subconscious fears.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Years of study at one of his home planet's new schools, established by men from Dansson, had led to his and Corbis's passing the series of examinations through which one could gain passage to the admired cynosure of Dansson—chief planet in Violet, principal sector of the galaxy. He remembered the ranks of unfamiliar machines, the sick excitement, and the flashing lights in the Danssonian embassy as the tests progressed, and the pleasure and surprise of learning that he had passed with honors. Now Corbis and he would be able to get work in Dansson and compete on more or less equal terms with the other families of humanity that congregated there. The challenge awed him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The announcer spoke to them again, more pressingly.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Corbis was climbing into the clothes cupboard as the mellow voice began once more to urge them to the hatch.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They're coming after us," she said. "They're coming to collect us. We must have been mad to let ourselves in for this."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He had no emotion, but it was clear he would have to go to her. He pulled himself out of bed and climbed into the single garment of poly fur he had been issued at the start of the journey. Then he went over and attempted to reason with her. He was still drowsy, and closed his eyes as he spoke.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's no good," she said. "I know we've been trapped and tricked, Saton. We shouldn't have trusted the Warms. They're bigger than us."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The beautiful yellow pupils of her eyes had contracted to slits in fear. As he looked at her, loving her, the fear suddenly enveloped him too. He was overcome by the distrust the Istinogurzibeshilahans had for the races of humanity they called Warms. It was the distrust the underprivileged feel for those who have the advantages, and because it was instinctive, it went deep. Corbis might well be right. He climbed into the cupboard with her.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She clutched him in the dark, whispering into his aural holes. "We can wait till the ship is empty, then we can escape."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Where to? Istinogurzibeshilaha is hundreds of thousands of light years from here."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We were told of a special quarter where our kind live— Little Istino, wasn't it? If such a place exists, we can go there and find help."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You are mad, Corbis. Let"s get out of here. What has given you these ideas? For years we longed to get here."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"While we were under light-freeze, I dreamed there were Warms here in our cabin. They moved us about and examined us while we were helpless, carrying out experiments on us, sampling my blood. There's a tiny plaster on my wrist that was not there before. Feel!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">He ran his fingers over the soft and tiny scales on her arm. The feel of the plaster, a symbol of medical care, only reassured him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You had a bad dream, that's all. We're still alive, aren't we?..."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As he spoke, he heard someone enter their cabin. They froze into immobility, listening. Someone came into the center of the room, stood there muttering under his breath, and went out again.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They lay there, huddled together for a long while, listening to the gentle flow of announcements over the speech glands. At last, the glands ceased, and silence filled the now-empty starship.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">Saton and Corbis moved slowly through the streets, partly compelled by caution, partly because they had still not entirely overcome the effects of enforced hibernation.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It had been easy to dodge the few cleaners working in the corridors of the ship, and only slightly harder to escape from the immense complex of the space port. But now, in the city itself, they were entirely at a loss.</p>

  <p class="block_17">At first they did not recognize that it was a city. Its buildings, by the rough-hewn standards of Istinogurzibeshilahan architecture, were scarcely recognizable as buildings. For here material had gone to create units that represented the essential nonsolidity of matter. Their shapes held enormous gaiety and ingenuity. Indeed, occasionally fantasy had been followed to the point of folly, but to the wondering eyes of Saton and Corbis all was beautiful.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Between the buildings were vast floral displays, terraced several stories high. Some of these were dark with mighty trees much like the trees that grew in the fertile places of Istinogurzibeshilaha. The forbidding as well as the engaging was prominent, so that nature was not too sentimentally represented. There were also terraces on which wild animals prowled, and immense aviaries where birds flew almost free. The total effect was that of an endless zoo.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saton and Corbis walked along a pedestrian way, anxious yet entranced. On sunken roads, formidably fast traffic slid through the city; overhead, air cars passed like missiles. On their own level, there were a great many people walking at leisurely paces, but both were too nervous to stop anyone and ask their way.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"If we had some money, we could get transportation to Little Istino," Corbis said. They had been issued Danssonian credit books on the ship, with the state of their finances entered into them. But by missing disembarkation, they had missed collecting currency.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"If we come to a cafe, we"ll try to pick up some information," Saton said. Unfortunately, they saw nothing resembling shops or cafes—or factories for that matter, for all of the strange buildings seemed purely residential.</p>

  <p class="block_17">After some minutes of walking, they came to a halt. Avenues stretched interminably in all directions; they could go on walking forever. Saton clutched Corbis's hand, motioning her to silence. He was watching a Warm nearby.</p>

  <p class="block_17">To judge from his appearance, the Warm was a velure, mutated human stock from Vermilion Sector, with a rich coat of fur; presumably in deference to local mores, he wore a light garment over his body. He had stopped at one of the shapely pillars that Saton and Corbis had been passing ever since they left the space field. The pillars bulged a couple of feet from the ground, tapering again higher up and ending in a spike some nine feet above ground.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The velure slid open a panel in the bulge of the pillar, inserted something from his pocket, and dialed. He waited.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Well below the level of the air cars, a series of massive piano-shaped objects sailed overhead. One of these pianos moved off its course now, descended slightly, and settled on top of the pillar so that the spike of the pillar plugged into a hole in its underside.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Lights flicked on the object and the velure dialed again.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Faint humming sounds came from the piano. A scoop descended from it down to pavement level, and a red light on the scoop flicked on and off. A green light came on; the scoop opened. From it the velure took something and continued on his way.</p>

  <p class="block_17">By the time the scoop had retracted into the piano, removed itself from the pillar, and resumed its aerial circuit, the velure had disappeared.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It was at this point that Saton realized that the watchers were being watched. A man stood close by, surveying them quizzically.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I believe you two are from out-system," he said, when they turned to look at him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What makes you think that?" Saton asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The man laughed gently. "I’ve seen people from out-system amazed at our microfab circuit before."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He came over to them. "Can I show you around or direct you anywhere? My time's my own this morning."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saxton and Corbis looked at each other.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The man put his hand out. "Name's Slen-Kater. Welcome to Dansson."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They hesitated until the hand was lowered.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We are happy on our own, thank you," Corbis said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Kater shrugged. He was a small, sturdy man with a wild mop of yellow hair, through which he now ran his rejected hand.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The fact that I'm a Warm and you're a Cold makes no difference to me," he said, "if that's what you're thinking."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Corbis twisted her neck in her peculiar gesture of anger. Saton said, "Thank you. We should be glad of your help. You see, after we disembarked my mate unfortunately lost her handbag. It contained all the money we possess."</p>

  <p class="block_17">At once Kater was all sympathy.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You've walked some way from the field. No doubt you'd like a drink before we get on our way. Perhaps you'll give me the pleasure."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We're very obliged to you," Saton said. He took Corbis's arm because she was still looking displeased.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No bother. Of course, you can dial yourself a drink on the microfab circuit if you have a Danssonian credit book. Look, I'll show you."</p>

  <p class="block_17">From his pocket he produced a credit book much like the ones Saton and Corbis had been issued. He flipped open the panel in the pillar and inserted his book in a scanner. There was an illuminated directory at the back of the recess; Kater flicked it to the drinks section, read out the number of a synthop, and dialed it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That sends a general call to one of the fab units," Kater said, pointing upward. "Here comes one. These units have antigravity devices to keep them airborne. They're the factories of Dansson. Each one is packed with complex machines no bigger than your body cells. As you may know, the speed of really small mechanical devices is terrifically high. This, one would throw together my own private air car, if I wished it, and assemble it right here on the spot—in under five minutes."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The piano settled on the top of the pillar, and Kater dialed again.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How do you pay for what you get?" Corbis asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There's a scale of charges. The charge is deducted against my credit rating. My credit number goes through even before I dial—off the front of my book. Ah, one synthop!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">The scoop came down from the piano, opened, and revealed a beaker full of an amber liquid. Kater picked it out, poured its contents onto the ground, and flung the glass into a trash chute in the base of the pUlar.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Now, let's go and get a sociable drink," he said.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">They sat at a pleasant table, drinking. Saton had chosen a warm liquid that went far toward fully reviving him from the recent light-freeze, and yet, somehow, he could not help feeling uneasy. Perhaps they should never have joined up with this creature with the yellow hair, who was saying cheerfully, "Oh, you'll be happy on Dansson."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How do you know I will be happy on Danison?" Corbis asked. "Perhaps I will be miserable here. Perhaps I will miss my home."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Kater smiled. "You'll be happy here," he said. "It's unavoidable."</p>

  <p class="block_17">To soothe things over, Saton said, "My mate really means that things seem very strange to us. Even the layout of the city is different from anything we know at home. For instance, your habit of building such massive big blocks and setting them among parkland is new to us. Why, this building we're in is almost as big as a city."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It is a city," Kater said. "Dansson is simply a nexus of cities, each interrelated with the others, but each with a function of its own. Since we managed to get all factory and distributive outlets mobile in the way you've seen, the old idea of a city has died. The result is that the distribution of population areas in Dansson is governed solely by social function."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The block they had entered to get to the cafe was shaped like an immense wedge standing with its tapering end toward the clouds. They sat looking down on an inner courtyard; gesturing out at it, Saton asked, "And what particular function has this building?'"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Well, we call it a classifomium. It's a sort of a—well, a museum-cum-zoo. Its contents come from all over the galaxy. I can show you around at least part of it, if you have the time."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saton saw from the corner of his eye that Corbis was signaling to him that they should escape from this Warm as soon as they had learned from him where Little Istino was; he realized that this was prudent. But something else happened to him. He was seized by an intense intellectual curiosity. He wanted to look into that museum, whatever happened. He knew that overwhelming curiosity of old; it had been responsible for the years in which he had sweated and toiled to prepare himself for the tests which, when passed, would bring him to Dansson, away from his dark-green home planet. And it was more than curiosity; it was a craving for knowledge. It was this, rather than fear, that led him to dread death, for death would mean an end to knowing, an end to learning, an end to the piecing together of facts that would eventually lead to an understanding of the whole strange scheme of things.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We've got the time," Saton said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Splendid!" Kater said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As he went to pay for their drinks, Corbis said, "We must get away now. Why do we stay with this man?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Rationalizing, Saton said, "We are as safe with Kater as with anyone. If we are being sought for, isn't a museum a good hiding-place? Time enough to get to Little Istino later."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Despairingly, she turned away. Her gaze caught a newscast that a patron of the cafe had left on the next table. She reached over and picked it up, hoping that perhaps it might contain a reference to that part of the city where then- kind lived, perhaps even a hint that would show them how to get there.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She could read the headlines, with their news of a food surplus in the southern hemisphere, clearly enough. But the ordinary print .... in the distant epoch when her ancestors had become nocturnal, many of their retinal cones ceased to develop and had become rods for better night vision; as a result the focus of her eyes was too coarse to achieve definition. She threw the cast down in vexation.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When Kater returned to the table, they joined him and followed him into the immense wedge of the classifornium.</p>

  <p class="block_17">With a sure sense of what would fascinate anyone from out-system, Kater took them to the Inficarium, where they plunged into a strange and wonderful world. As they stopped to stare in awe at the huge main corridor of the Inficarium, Kater grinned at them. "Infectious disease has been wiped out on Dansson, and on most of the major planets in the sector," he said. "We are apt to forget that throughout the greater part of man's history disease was a common experience of everyday life. Nowadays, with infectious illness eliminated, many of the once-common bacteria and virus that caused disease are threatened with extinction. A few eras ago the IDPA—the Infectious Diseases Preservation Association— was set up, and many interesting strains were saved from dying out and brought here. This Inficarium, in its present form, is fairly recent."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Fascinated, Saton and Corbis went from gallery to gallery, peering through optical instruments that allowed them to view the various exhibits. In the Virus Hall they studied the groups of virus that once infested plants, the rare ones that</p>

  <p class="block_17">infested fish and frogs and amphibians, and all the prolific varieties that once ranged almost at will throughout the phyla of animal life.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You see how beautiful, how individual they are, and how wonderfully developed to survive in their particular environments," Kater said. "They make you realize what a small part of life-sensation man is able to apprehend direct. It is a sad commentary on our times that they were permitted to get so near to extinction."</p>

  <p class="block_17">In the next gallery they found some of the viruses, now grown on tissue cultures, which caused the diseases that had once infested man. First came the general infectious diseases, such as yellow fever, dengue, smallpox, measles, and similar strains. They were followed by the viruses infecting a particular part of the body: the influenzas, the parainfluenzas, adenoviruses, the enteroviruses, such as the three poliomyelitis viruses, and the lymphogranuloma inguinale virus present in venereal diseases.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Then they passed to the infections damaging the nervous system, and from there to the near relations of the viruses, the Rickettsiae, and from there into the Bacteria House, and so eventually, dazed, into the Protozoa House. By this time, the coarse-focus eyes of Corbis and Saton were exhausted, and they had to call a halt.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Leaving Kater to wait for them by one of the exits, they went to rinse their faces and cool their pupils. This gave Corbis the chance to insist that they make for Little Istino straight away.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saton decided to ask Slen-Kater about the region. When he did, the velure said that it was not far—in fact, he would show them how to get there.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"First, before we leave here, you will have to have an inoculation."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What for?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's a precaution the governors of the Inficarium have to take—^just in case any of the diseases escaped, you know," Kater explained. "It won't take a minute."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saton was still remote, his mind taken up with the tremendous range of alien life they had seen. When Corbis started to protest, he cut her off. It was to see things like the Inficarium that he had worked to get to Dansson, and his patience with her fears grew less by the hour.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She sensed this. After they had received their inoculation in a little ba/next to the exit, she turned to the Warm.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We did not expect such kindness as you have shown us on our first day on Dansson," she said. "My mate is less anxious than I about adjusting to this planet. I feel that we are despised as an inferior species of man."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Unperturbed, Kater said, "That feeling will die very soon."</p>

  <p class="block_17">There was a silence as they walked along outside.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saton said, "Do not embarrass Slen-Kater. Let him show us the way to Little Istino, and then we must take up no more of his time."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh, I don't embarrass him; he would not mind what I said if he thought they were the words of an inferior breed. Would you like the history of us Colds who live on Istinogurzibeshilaha? You might find us as interesting as your rare diseases."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Kater smiled at that. "We have come to the station where you can catch a ground car for Little Istino—though I'm sure your history would have been very interesting."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As he turned to go, Saton said humbly, "Slen-Kater, you must forgive us—our manners are upset after the light-journey. We still have one favor to ask you."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Please, Saton, ask someone else!" ^orbis whispered, but as Kater turned toward them, Saton indicated the notice board by their side. "Our eyes cannot adjust to the fine print, and we cannot read our destination. Would you be kind enough to see us into the right car?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Certainly."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And there's another thing—could you lend us the price of the fare? If we could have your credit number, we will repay you when we get established."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"By all means," Kater said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You may guess how unhappy we are at having to ask such degrading favors."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Nobody stays unhappy on Dansson—don't worry!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">The business of obtaining a ticket from the complex of coin machines and then of descending to the right level looked very formidable to the strangers. The station was large and appeared to house a maze of alternative routes. Also, it was uncomfortably warm, and they could feel their body temperature rising. The pulses in their throats beat faster.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This car will get you to Little Istino," Kater said, as a yellow polyhedron slid into the platform. "This is single-level service, so you will only have ten stops before you are there."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As they hesitated by the door, Saton grasped his hand. "You have been so hospitable, we cannot thank you enough. There is just one thing—where do we go when we get out at the other end?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't you think we can ask when we get there?" Corbis interjected.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Smiling, Kater got into the car with them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's not all that much out of my way," he said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As the car gathered speed, Corbis said, "I really don't know why you have come along with us. Do you take us for interesting freaks?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We're all interesting freaks, if it comes to that. I just want to help you get to where you wish to go. Is that so strange?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And so all the while you must be thinking of us as poor cold-blooded creatures."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm afraid my mate has rather a chip on her shoulder at present," Saton said. "The mere size of this city is so overwhelming "</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't be silly," Corbis said. "Didn't you feel inferior when you saw that in this place they have to strive to protect from extinction diseases that hunch-eds of people on Istinogurzibeshilaha die of every year? And it is apparent we can't think so efficiently as this gentleman, or see so well, or read with the same ability."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She broke off and turned to Kater. "I'm sure you will excuse my behavior and put it all down to my natural inferiority. Perhaps you have time to learn something of the history of man on Istinogurzibeshilaha, since you are so interested in us?</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'll give it you in a nutshell—we've lived through two million years of underprivilege.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I don't remember how long there have been forms of space travel, but it's a long, long time. And about two million years ago, a big trans vacuum liner got into trouble and had to put down on Istinogurzibeshilaha. Its drive was burned out or something. Do you know what the world was like that those men and women found? It was barren and desolate, without the amenities you take for granted on Dansson. Most of it consisted of bare and lifeless soil—there weren't enough earthworms and bacteria in the ground to render it fertile enough for plants. True, some vegetation did exist, but this jwas limited to primitive plants and trees—spore and cone-bearing things like cycads and giant ferns, spruce and pine, and the giant sequoias.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh, don't think such a dark-green world does not possess [a certain amount of grandeur. It does. But—no grass, no flowers, none of the angiosperms with their little seed pods that are embryo plants and afford nourishment for other plant life. You see what I mean. Istinogurzibeshilaha was at the beginning of its Lower Triassic period of evolutionary growth.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Why do I say 'was'? It still is! In another thirty million years or so we shall just about graduate into the Jurassic.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Can you imagine what an ordeal those first men and women went through? In those deserts and dark forests, what is there for a warm-blooded man? Nothing! Not even animals he can kill! The mammals have yet to arrive on our planet, because you don't get them until the higher-energy foods available in flowering plants materialize.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The early reptiles roam about—stupid, inefficient, slow-moving, cold-blooded things—existing on what nourishment is available. And amphibians. Fish and crustaceans, of course. They provide food."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As she talked, her tone lost its earlier resentment. Her eyes rested on Kater's face as if it was merely an outcrop of that stern landscape she described. Saton sat looking out of the window, watching mile after mile of the galactic city flash by. Dusk was falling; the fantastic towers seemed to float in space.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Those people—our ancestors—had to live off the land when their own supplies ran out. They had a fight, I can tell you. They had their own grain, but the grain failed when sown. It just wasn't the right environment. So the people lived off the low-energy-level foods that were available.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It was quite a change of diet. And you know what happened? They didn't die out. They adapted. Maybe it would have been better if they had died out—we would not be here. Because to adapt meant that they slowly became cold-blooded. When life begins on a planet, it always starts cold-blooded; in the circumstances, cold blood is a survival factor—did you know that, Slen-Kater? That way, life is lived slowly, and it can survive on the vitamin-poor diet available. Much later along the evolutionary path, you get chemical reactions in the bloodstream, which heat it, caused by eating new foods— the richer foods that follow in the wake of the seed-bearing plants.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Evolution played a trick on our ancestors. It sent them backward down the path. They became—we are—reptiles."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's nonsense," Saton said. "We are still men, simply cold-blooded."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Corbis laughed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh, yes, there are worse than us. Our unhappy ancestors went feral when their blood started running cold. For thousands of years, they were nocturnal in habit. One group of them, about fifty strong, left the rest and took to a semi^ aquatic life in the region of the Assh-hassis Delta. You should see their descendants today, Slen-Kater! Why, they arent even viviparous! However alien I am to you, at least I don"t lay eggs!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">She burst into ragged laughter, and Saton put his arms around her.</p>

  <p class="block_17">After a silence, Kater said, "I expect you know the history of Dansson. We—man—destroyed the seventy-seven natioj of bipedal Danssonians before we took over the planet. would think our history is more disgraceful than yours, if we are competing for disgrace."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Corbis turned and looked at him with interest.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I hope you are feeling better now," he said to her. "We are just about to get out."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The ground car had stopped several times while she had been talking. Now it stopped again, and they alighted. When they climbed above-ground, it was to survey a part of the city much like the part they had left, except that here the great buildings were more conservative in shape and more riotous in color. The microfab system floated over their heads, shuttling its piano-shaped objects through the dusk.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Kater halted and pointed out a scarlet building down the avenue to their left.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's Little Istino. You will feel at home among people from your own planet—but don't forget we are all basically of the same kind."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I wish to apologize for being rude earlier," Corbis said. "I will make no excuses, but I was feeling very unhappy. Now I feel much more content."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Strangely enough, so do I," Saton said. "It must be your company!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Slen-Kater laughed. "No, it's not that. Perhaps I will walk along with you right to your door. You're finding it hard to get rid of me, aren't you? You see, there is a reason why you are feeling happier."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They walked by his side, looking curiously at him as he continued.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am an immigration officer. I was asked to follow you when you did not check in for your inoculations at the space field. No, no, don't look so alarmed. With every ship that comes in we run into the same problem of people who for one reason or another don't want to come and see us. They often prove to be the brightest and most interesting."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"After all this are you going to arrest us?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Certainly not. I have no need to. You will be peaceable and content here."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You sound very confident," Corbis said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"With reason. Everyone who lives on or comes to Dansson is inoculated against unhappiness. Oh yes, we have a serum. Happiness is purely a glandular state. There's no illness here, as you know. Give a man the right glandular balance, and he will be happy. You had your inoculation that you missed at the space field as we left the Inficarium."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Wait a minute," Saton said, stopping abruptly. "You said that was a routine shot to ensure we had not picked up any diseases."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"My dear Saton—there was no possible danger of that</p>

  <p class="block_17">Those dangerous little life forms are all sealed away safely. No, it seemed a good time to make you feel happier. It has worked already, hasn't it?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Saton raised his fists, looked at them, and laughed. There was no force in them, no core to his anger, no dismay in his surprise. He seized Corbis's arm and hurried her along, excited at the feeling of pleasure that swept over him. They certainly knew how to live on Dansson.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Do you have these injections too, Slen-Kater?" Corbis asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Certainly. Only being resident, I don't need as much as . . . as visitors. Only the very eminent are allowed to be creatively miserable. As you're new here, you've had a stiff dose to tide you over the next few months."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She tried to feel vexed at this. Somehow she thought there was something in his statement that should have roused her apprehensions. Instead, she could only see what a joke he had played on them. She giggled, and was still giggling when they reached the scarlet structure, towering high above them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This is Little Istino, and you'll be fine here. There are' plenty of your own kind within," Kater said. "And none of those egg-laying Assh-hassis to worry you. They have a separate block elsewhere in the city."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You mean you have them here too? What use can they be to a wonderful modem planet like Dansson?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Immigration Officer Kater stuck his hands in his pocki and looked down genially at them; they were nice little being really.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I admit the Assh-hassis aren't much use" he said. "Bi then neither are many of the thousands of lesser races of ms we house here. You see, as true man spreads across this part of the galaxy, he is slowly wiping out those half-brothers who are no match for him. So they have to be preserved—for study and so on. It's roughly like the viruses, I suppose."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Corbis and Saton looked at each other.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I never thought of the Assh-hassis as a virus," Saton said.! "They'll be amused when we get back to Istinogurzibeshilaha and tell our people."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh, you'll never go back there," Kater said. "No one ever leaves Dansson."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Why not?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">He smiled. "You'll see. You'll be too happy to leave."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They were still laughing as they parted from him, the best of friends all around.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That was a very comical remark he made," Corbis said, as they waved him farewell, "about parts of Dansson being reserved for inferior types of human—almost like a cage in a zoo, except I suppose the inhabitants don't notice the bars." </p>

  <p class="block_17">"Wouldn't the Assh-hassis be furious if they realized the truth?" Saton chuckled.</p>

  <p class="block_19"><span class="text_7">Arm in arm, they turned and hurried into the big scarlet cage.</span><span class="text_1"><br class="calibre1" id="calibre_pb_6"/>
