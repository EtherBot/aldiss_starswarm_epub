  <p class="block_15">INTRODUCTION</p>

  <p class="block_15">by Brian Aldiss</p>
<br>
  <p class="block_16">To be a science-fiction writer is to be a curiosity not only to one’s neighbours—all men are curiosities to their neighbours— but also to the national press.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Many reviewers do not know how to take science-fiction writers. The man who wrote in Reynolds News of one of my previous books that it ‘contained not one important new fore­cast’ was obviously hoping for a cross between Old Moore and the Air Ministry roof. Then there was that delightful conclud­ing sentence of Mr. John Coleman’s friendly review in The Spectator. ‘Mr. Aldiss knows all about chromosomes, but he seems, agreeably enough, to be almost totally uninterested in sex.’</p>

  <p class="block_17">What a wild goose starts up here, inviting chase! Is it pos­sible to strike the right tone of voice so that sex and chromo­somes combine happily in one story? For more years than one cares to remember, this matter has been debated in sf circles.
  
  </p>

  <p class="block_17">And the other strange delusions that reviewers suffer. What tales one might tell if one would! There was, for instance, the amiable gentleman on The Dudley Herald who was percep­tive enough to compare my writing with Olaf Stapledon’s, only to spoil the good work by complaining of the rest of the field that ‘every author with a couple of mediocre detective tales to his discredit seems to be climbing on to the sf band­wagon’. (The actual situation is that a few mediocre sf writers have become mediocre in other fields, producing thrillers among other work. Nobody minds.)
 
</p>

  <p class="block_17">Other critics imagine that science fiction sells phenomenally well in this country. Others think it is all a dreadful conspiracy.
 
</p>

  <p class="block_17">I hate to say anything against my publishers, for one does not bite the hand that starves one, but they have been very slow to issue disclaimers and explain that sf writers are human, never write best-sellers, and get published under the mundane arrangements that apply to other authors (arrangements roughly classifiable as Survival of the Fittest). They have, how­ever, allowed me a space in which to say something about sf.
 
</p>

  <p class="block_17">Perhaps the one thing worth saying is that it is almost im­possible to say anything very fruitful about sf in general. There is only X’s science fiction and Y’s science fiction (not to mention Z’s space opera), and because X and Y may be of very different temperaments, their stories will contain different qualities.                                                                                   
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
Sf is not all of a piece. One can make not only the valid distinction that some of it is very good and much of it very poor; one has also to say that every worth-while writer makes an individual contribution. Thus, Arthur C. Clarke’s sf is often concerned with forthcoming technological innovations. He is, indeed, likely to go down in history as the man who first thought of telstar. One has also to say that John Wyndham’s and John Christopher’s sf is in some respects the very opposite     of this; that such novels as their Day of the Triffids and Death of Grass are symptoms of a revolt against an increasingly technological and inhuman society (I suspect that this is one reason why they have achieved their great popularity). One has to say that William Tenn is most interested in a techno­logical society when it emphasizes human weaknesses already apparent. One has to say that Frederik Pohl exposes present-day economic evils by projecting them on to the future. And so on. To each his own metier.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
Only when these authors can be dealt with as individuals and not as some sort of outcrop of a vast mass mind that occasionally defecates a burst of ‘space fiction’ will criticism come out of its paleolithic era.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
All the same, there are some interesting figures stirring in the early dawn. The number of critics who can say something worth while about sf grows. It includes, for instance, Kenneth Allsop, John Bowen, Alan Brien, G. D. Doherty, Robert Conquest, Miss Stevie Smith, Colin Wilson, Angus Wilson, and Kenneth Young. (We all know about Messrs. Amis, Boardman, and Crispin, who were up before first light.)
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
These critics—and happily the list is incomplete—-know that if an sf story fails by ordinary literate standards, it has failed; they also know that it needs something extra to succeed. And this extra demand has to be allowed for.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
To define this ‘extra something’ is not easy without falling into generalization. But look at it this way.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
A writer of traditional fiction writes a book, a novel. It centres round the problem three men have in seducing a girl, their various approaches and her various retreats.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
A writer of sf writes a novel. He begins by creating a new solar system and a future time to set it in. In that system he sets one planet in particular, gives it an appropriate biosphere and an ecology within that biosphere. He gives his creatures life and purpose, gives them a social system, domestic life, architecture, and a local substitute for Coca-Cola. He brings, in some visiting Earthmen. Then he sets to work on Chapter One.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
An sf writer works hard for his living. He may be excused if he becomes impatient when a reviewer reads his work and says, ‘No characterization’. He may be excused if he replies, with the well-known humility of any author facing any stric­tures, ‘You mean you want characterization as well?’
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
The odd thing is that much sf does contain at least adequate characterization. What one is less entitled to expect is that interplay of character which marks the novels held in highest esteem by the Leavis school of criticism, novels by Jane Austen, Henry James, and D. H. Lawrence. The interplay of relationships that goes on in a lot of sf is between man and X the unknown; and in such cases there is no room for any depth between personal relationships.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
And so I come to these airs of Earth. Some of them do seem to be about personal relationships—the first one, for instance, centres round them. Yet they are always about something else as well. It’s a confusing situation about which a few words might well be said—by someone else.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
I don’t think these airs on a G-strain are much like any other writer’s, though they show some variety among themselves. The majority of ‘them have not been given benefit of escape velocity, and take place on Earth, though the Earths differ considerably, some being tomorrow’s possible Earth, some the Earths of the remote future. Space is a bit passé these days, now that the Russian and American tourist season is getting into full swing. One of the two that are set away in the galaxy, ‘The Game of God’ is an attempt—and attempt I make too seldom—to write ‘proper sf’, with a problem that introduces parasitology, or in this case para-parasitology. And ‘O Moon of my Delight!’ is a shot at imagining a personal case history not covered by Havelock Ellis because it could only occur under special extra-terrestrial circumstances.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
Of the other stories, I must push ‘Old Hundredth’ forward by saying that it was written for the centenary issue of Britain’s oldest sf magazine, New Worlds.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
‘Basis for Negotiation’ also appeared in the same magazine, and caused much discontent there. It concerns the outbreak of a Third World War in which Britain remains neutral. I was accused of holding certain attitudes to certain political parties, and to certain sexual propensities, even of taking the name of C.N.D. in vain; one reader, bolder than the rest, suggested I had written in my cups. Not all these charges do I deny, though I hope a perceptive reader will find the story fights its real battle on other battlefields. Anyhow, the story remains; I have even included here an ironic echo to it. ‘The International Smile’. I should say that ‘Basis’ is somewhat revised. For that I must thank John Baxter, an Australian reader whose criticisms have been very useful. Often the most perceptive critics come from within the ranks of the so-called fans. Which is understandable; they share the major kink of sf writers—a deep and irrational devotion to science fiction.
 </p>

  <p class="block_17">
But between the critics and the fans lies the mysterious land where the ordinary reader lives. This is the land wherein the writer can never tread; it is almost impossible for him to have commerce with it (populous though the place is, its people go masked). So he sends into it an occasional tender, hoping it may prove of value, hoping the natives will prove friendly.
