  <p class="block_15">SECTOR AZURE</p>
  <p style="margin:0pt; orphans:0; text-align:center; widows:0"><a id="soldier"></a>

 <br>


  <p class="block_21">Even in a survey of contemporary Starswarm so brief as this it would be absurd not to look at the most used form of galactic transportation.</p>

  <p class="block_22">The mattermitters of Sector Yellow and the Burst, or the leisurely lightpushers that are popular in remote regions like sectors Gray or Violet, carry between them only fifteen percent of the galaxy's traffic. Small ferry ships and freighters such as those operated by TransBurst Traders account for another eighteen percent. The rest of the tonnage, goods or passenger, plunges through phase space in FTL (faster-than-light) ships.</p>

  <p class="block_22">The history of the starships is too well known for us to need to go into it here. Many civilizations go through phases in their development when their most typical transport is the oxcart, the stagecoach, or some kind of train. Particularly in their obsolescent stages, these forms of transport excite much affection.</p>

  <p class="block_22">But the FTL ships are most loved of all. They have taken many forms. Always they are just developing or becoming obsolete in some part of Starswarm. We know that Dansson and the Fire Planets of Sector Diamond cut themselves off from the rest of the galaxy during Eras 83, 84, and 85, and forbade all movement by FTL to or from their planets.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Such post-technological epochs are common. They pass—indeed, under the Theory of Multigrade Superannuation, they must pass. Then the FTL ships roar back.</p>

  <p class="block_22">The following narrative deals with an incident in Sector Azure, where they are developing new (for them) braking systems for their ships. The story, however, does not concern technicalities. It shows what can happen to human character when influenced by new technologies.</p>

  <p class="block_22">If you will, you can regard it as a study in a new (for Azure) perversion. Or you may prefer to think of it as an example of the old (for Azure) problem of where a man should direct his love.</p>

  <br/>
  <br>
<br/>
  <br>

  <p class="block_16">Murrag lay on the ground to await consummation. It was less than five minutes away, and it would fall from the air.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The alarms had sounded near and distant. Their echoes had died from the high hills of Region Six. Stretched full length on the edge of a grassy cliff, Murrag Harri adjusted the plugs in his ears and laid his fume mask ready by his side.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Everything was calm and silent now, the whole world silent. And in him there was a growing tension, as strange and ever delightful as the tensions of love.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He raised oculars to his eyes and peered into the valley, where lay the Flange, that wide and forbidden highway down which the starships blazed. Even from his elevation, he could hardly discern the other side of the Flange; it ran east-west right around the equator of Tandy Two, unbroken and unalterable, an undeviating—he'd forgotten the figure—ten, was it, or twelve, or fifteen miles wide. In the sunlight the innumerable facets of the Flange glittered and moved.</p>

  <p class="block_17">His glasses picked out the mountains on the south side of the Flange. Black and white they were, gnawed as clean as a dead man's ribs under the abrasion of total vacuum.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">"I must bring Fay here before she goes back to Earth," he said aloud. "Wonderful, wonderful." Assuming a different tone, he said, "There is terror here on Tandy's equator, terror and sublimity. The most awesome place in Starswarm. Where vacuum and atmosphere kiss: and the kiss is a kiss of death! Yes. Remember that: The kiss is a kiss of death.'"</p>

  <p class="block_17">In his little leisure time Murrag was writing—he had been ever since I first met him—a book about Tandy Two as he experienced it. Yet he knew, he told me, that the sentences he formed there on the hill were too highly colored, too big, too false. Under his excitement, more truthful images struggled to be born.</p>

  <p class="block_17">While they struggled, while he lay and wished he had brought Fay with him, the starship came in.</p>

  <p class="block_17">This! This was the moment, the fearsome apocalyptic moment! Unthinking, he dropped his oculars and ducked his head to the earth, clinging to it in desperate excitement with all his bones from his toes to his skull.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tandy Two <i class="calibre7">lurched</i>.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The FTL ship burst into normal space on automatic control, invisible and unheard at first. Boring for the world like a metal fist swung at a defenseless heart, it was a gale of force. It was brutality . . . but it skimmed the Flange as gently as a kiss brushes a lover's cheek.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Yet so mighty was that gentleness that for an instant a loop of fire was spun completely around Tandy Two. Over the Flange a mirage flickered: a curious elongated blur that only an educated retina could take for the afterimage of a faster-than-light ship chasing to catch up with its object. Then a haze arose, obscuring the Flange. Cerenkov radiations flickered outward, distorting vision.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The transgravitic screens to the north of the Flange—on Murrag's side of it, and ranged along the valley beneath his perch—buckled but held, as they always held. The towering BGL pylons were bathed in amber. Atmosphere and vacuum roared at each other from either side of the invisible screens. But as ever, the wafer-thin geogravitics held them apart, held order and chaos separate.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A gale swept up the mountainsides.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The sun jerked wildly across the sky.</p>

  <p class="block_17">All this happened in one instant.</p>

  <p class="block_17">And in the next moment it was deepest night.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag dug his hands out of the soft earth and stood up. His chest was soaked with sweat, his trousers were damp. Trembling, he clamped his fume mask over his face, guarding himself against the gases generated by the FTL's passage.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tears still ran down his face as he limply turned to make his way back to the highland farm.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Kiss of death, embrace of flame ...." he muttered to himself as he climbed aboard his tractor; but still the elusive image he wanted did not come.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In a fold of hills facing north lay the farmhouse, burrowed deeply into the granite just in case of accidents. Murrag's lights washed-over it. Its outhouses were terraced below it, covered pen after covered pen, all full of Farmer Dourt's sheep, locked in as always during entry time; not a single animal could be allowed outside when an FTL came down.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Everything lay still as Murrag drove up in his tractor. Even the sheep were silent, crouching mutely under the jack-in-a-box dark. Not a bird flew, not an insect sparked into the lights; such life had almost died out during the hundred years the Flange had been in operation. The toxic gases hardly encouraged fecundity in nature.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Soon Tandy itself might rise to shine down on its earthlike second moon. The planet Tandy was a gas giant, a beautiful object when it rose into Tandy Two's skies, but uninhabitable and unapproachable.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tandy One equally was not a place for human beings. But the second satellite, Tandy Two, was a gentle world with mild seasons and an oxygen-nitrogen atmosphere. People lived on Tandy Two, loved, hated, struggled, aspired there as on any of the multitudinous civilized planets in Sector Azure, but with this difference: that because there was something individual about Tandy Two, there was something individual about its problems.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The southern hemisphere of Tandy Two was lifeless under vacuum; the northern existed mainly for the vast terminal towns of Blerion, Touchdown, and Ma-Gee-Neh. Apart from the cities, there was nothing but grassland—grass and lakes and silicone desert stretching to the pole. And by courtesy an occasional sheep farm was allowed on the grasslands.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What a satellite!" Murrag exclaimed, climbing from the tractor. Admiration sounded in his voice. He was a curious man, Murrag Harri—but I'll stick to fact and let you understand what you will.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He pushed through the spaced double doors that served the Dourt farmstead as a crude air lock when the gases were about. In the living-eating-cooking complex beyond. Col Dourt himself stood by the CV watching its colors absently. He looked up as Murrag removed his face mask.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Good <i class="calibre7">evening</i>, Murrag," he said with heavy jocularity. "Great to see so nice a morning followed by so nice a night without so much as a sunset in between."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You should be used to it by now," Murrag murmured, hanging his oculars with his jacket in the A-G cupboard. After being alone in the overwhelming presence of Tandy, it always took him a moment to adjust to people again.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"So I should, so I should. Fourteen earth years and I still see red to think how men have bollixed about with one of God's worlds. Thank heaven we'll all be off this crazy moon in another three weeks! I can't wait to see Droxy, I'm telling you."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You’ll miss the grasslands and the open spaces."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"So you keep telling me. What do you think I am? One of my sheep! Just as soon—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"But once you get away—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Just a minute, Murrag!" Dourt held up a brown hand as he cocked his eye at the CV. "Here comes Touchdown to tell us if it's bedtime yet."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag halted on the way upstairs to his room. He came back to peer into the globe with the shepherd. Even Hoc the house dog glanced up momentarily at the assured face that appeared in the bright bowl.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"CVA Touchdown talking," the face said, smiling at its unseen audience. "The FTL ship Droijoln made a safe and successful entry on the Flange some three hundred and twenty miles outside Touchdown station. As you can see from this live shot, passengers are already being met by helicar and taken to the FTL port in Touchdown. The Droffoln comes from Ryvriss XIII in Sector Maroon. You are looking at a typical Ryvrissian now. He is, as you observe, octipedal.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We will bring you news and interviews with passengers and crews when all the occupants of the FTL have undergone revival. At present they remain under light-freeze.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We go now to Chronos-Touchdown for the revised time check."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The assured face gave way to a shaggy one. Behind it, the untidy computing room of this astronomical department greeted viewers. The shaggy face smiled. "As yet we have only a rough scheme for you. It will, as usual, take a little while to feed accurate figures into our machines, and some reports have still to come in.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Meanwhile, here is an approximate time check. The FTL ship entered Flange influence at roughly 1219 hours 47.66 seconds today, Seventeenday of Cowl Month. Impetus-absorption thrust Tandy through approximately 108.75 degrees axial revolution in approximately 200 milliseconds. So the time at the end of that very short period became roughly 1934 hours 47.66 seconds.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Since that was about twenty-four and a half minutes ago, the time to which everyone in Touchdown zone should set their watches and clocks is . . . coming up . . , 1959 hours and 18 seconds .... Now! I repeat, the time is now 1959 hours, one minute to eight o'clock at night, plus 18 seconds.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It is still, of course, Seventeenday of Cowl.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We shall be back to bring you more accurate information on the time in another two hours."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dourt snorted and switched the globe off. It slid obediently out of sight into the wall.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Here I've just had my midday bite," he growled, "and there's Bes upstairs putting the kids to bed!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's what happens on Tandy Two," Murrag replied, edging from the room. Without wishing to seem rude, he was bored with Dourt's complaints, which occurred with little variation once a fortnight—whenever, in fact, an FTL ship arrived. He ducked out of the room and almost scuttled up the stairs.</p>

  <p class="block_16">"It may happen on Tandy Two," Dourt said, not averse to having only Hoc to talk to, "but that don't mean to say Col Dourt has to like it." He squared his broad shoulders, thrust out his chest, and stuck his thumbs in his spunsteel jacket. "I was bom on Droxy, where a man gets twenty-four hours to his day—every day."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Hoc thumped his tail idly as if in ironic applause.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">As Murrag came upstairs, Tes marched past him on her way from the washing room. She was absolutely naked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"High time the girl was taken to civilization and learned the common rules of decency," Murrag thought good-humoredly.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The girl was several months past her thirteenth birthday. Perhaps it was as well the Dourt family were off back to Droxy in three weeks.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Going to bed at this hour of the day!" Tes grunted, not deigning to look at her father's helper as she thudded past him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's eight o'clock at night. The man on the CV has just said so," Murrag replied.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Poof!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">With that she disappeared into her room. Murrag entered into his room. He took the time changes in his stride; on Tandy now the changes had to be considered natural, for use can almost change the stamp of nature. Life on the farm was rigorous. Murrag, Dourt, and his wife rose early and went to sleep early. Murrag planned to lie and think for an hour, possibly to write a page more of his book, and then to take a somnulizer and sleep till four the next morning.</p>

  <p class="block_17">His thinking had no time to grow elaborate and deep. The door burst open and Fay rushed in, squealing with exuberance.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Did you see it? Did you see it?" she asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He had no need to ask to what she referred.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I sat on the top of the cliff and watched it," he said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You are lucky!" She did a pirouette, and pulled an ugly grimace at him. "That's what I call my life-begins-at-forty face, Murrag; did it scare you? Oh, to see one of those star-ships actually plunk down in the Flange. Tell me all about it!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">She wore only vest and knickers. A tangle of arms and legs flashed as she jumped onto the bed beside him and began tugging his ears. She was six—gay, primitive, unpredictable.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You're supposed to be in bed. Your mother will be after you, girl."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"She's always after me. Tell me about the starships, and how they land, and—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"When you've wrenched my ears off, I will."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He was not easy with her leaning on him. Rising, he pointed out of his little window with its double panes. Since his room was at the front of the farmhouse, he had this view out across the valley. The girls slept in a room considered more safe, at the back of the house, tucked into solid granite ("the living granite," Dourt always called it), and without windows.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Outside there now. Fay," he said, as the little girl peered into the dark, "are vapors that would make you ill if you inhaled them. They are breathed off by the Flange under the stress of absorbing the speed of the FTL ships. The geogravitic screens on this side of the Flange undergo terrific pressures and do very peculiar things. But the beautiful part is that when we wake in the morning the odors will all have blown away; Tandy itself, this marvelous moon we live on, will absorb them and send us a fresh supply of clean mountain air to breathe."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Do the mountains have air?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We call the air on the mountains 'mountain air.' That's all it means."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As he sat down beside her, she asked, "Do the vapors make it dark so quickly?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No they don't, Fay, and you know they don't. I've explained that before. The faster-than-light ships do that."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Are the vaster-than-light ships dark?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Faster-than-light. No, they're not dark. They come in from deep space so fast—at speeds above that of light, because those are the only speeds they can travel at—that they shoot right around Tandy one and a half times before the Flange can stop them, before its works can absorb the ship's momentum. And in so doing they twirl Tandy around a bit on its axis with them."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Like turntables?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's what I told you, didn't I? If you ran very fast onto a light wooden turntable that was not moving, you would stop, but your motion would make the turntable turn— transference of energy, in other words. And this twirling sometimes moves us around from sunshine into darkness."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Like today. I bet you were scared out on the hillside when it suddenly got dark!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">He tickled her in the ribs.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No I wasn't, because I was prepared for it. But that's why we have to get your Daddy's sheep all safely under cover before a ship comes—otherwise they'd all get scared and jump over precipices and things, and then your Daddy'd lose all his money and you wouldn't be able to go back to Droxy."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Fay looked meditatively at him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Those vaster-than-light ships are rather a nuisance to us, aren't they?" she said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag roared with laughter.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"If you put it like that " he began, when Mrs. Dourt thrust her head around the door.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There you are. Fay! I thought as much. Come and get into bed at once."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Bes Dourt was a solid woman in her early forties, plain, very clean. She of them all was least at home on Tandy Two, yet she seldom grumbled about it; among all her many faults one could not include grumbling. She marched into Murrag's room and seized her younger daughter by the wrists.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You're killing me!" Fay yelled in feigned agony. "Murrag and I were discussing transparency of energy. Let me kiss him good night and then I'll come. He is a lovely man, and I wish he was coming to Droxy with us."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She gave Murrag an explosive buss that rocked him backward. Then she rushed from the room. Bes paused before following; she winked at Murrag.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Pity you don't like anyone else to carry on a bit more in that style, Mr. Harri," she said, and shut the door after her as she left.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It was something of a relief to him that her advances were now replaced by nothing more trying than innuendo. Murrag put his feet up on the bed and lay back.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He looked around the room with its spare plastic furniture. This would be home for only three weeks more: then he would move on to work for Farmer Cay in Region Five. Nothing would he miss—except Fay, who alone among all the people he knew shared his curiosity and his love for Tandy Two.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A phrase of hers floated back to him—"the faster-than-light ships." Oddly appropriate name for craft existing in "phase space," where their mass exceeded "normal" infinity! His mind began, to play with the little girl's phrase; reverie overcame him, so that in sinking down into a nest of his own thought he found, even amid the complexity gathered around him, a comforting simplicity, a simplicity he had learned to look for because it told him that to see clearly into his own inner nature, he had merely to crystallize the attraction Tandy Two held for him and all would be clear eternally; he would be a man free of shackles, or free at least to unlock them when he wished. So again, as on the cliff and as many times before, he plunged through the deceptions of the imagination toward that wished-for truthful image.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Perhaps his search itself was a delusion; but it led him to sleep.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag and Dourt were out early in the cool hour before dawn. The air, as Murrag had predicted, was sweet to breathe again, washed by a light rain.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Hoc and the other dog—Pedo, the yard dog—ran with them as they whistled out the autocollies. Ten of them came pogoing into the open, light machines unfailingly obedient to the instructions from Dourt's throat mike. Although they had their limitations, they could herd sheep twice as quickly as live dogs. Murrag unlocked the doors of the great covered pens. The autocollies went in to get the sheep as he climbed aboard his tractor. The sheep poured forth, bleating into the open, and he and Dourt revved their engines and followed behind, watching as the flock fanned out toward the grasslands. They bumped along, keeping the autocollies constantly on course.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dawn seeped through the eastern clouds, and the rain stopped. Filmy sun created miracles of chiaroscuro over valley and hill. By then they had the sheep split into four flocks, each established on a separate hillside. They returned to the farm in time to breakfast with the rest of the family.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Do they get miserable wet days on Droxy like this?" Tes asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Nothing wrong with today. Rain's holding off now," her father said. Breakfast was not his best meal.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It depends on what part of Droxy you live in, just as it does here, you silly girl," said her mother.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They haven't got any weather in the south half of Tandy," Fay volunteered, talking around a mouthful, " 'cuz it's had to be vacuumized so's the starships coming in at such a lick wouldn't hit any molecules of air and get wrecked, and without air you don't have weather—isn't that so, Murrag?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag agreed it was so.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Shut up talking about the Flange. It's all you seem to think of these days, young lady," Dourt growled.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I never mentioned the Flange, Daddy. You did."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm not interested in arguing, Fay, so save your energy. You're getting too cheeky these days."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She put both elbows on the plastic table and said with deliberate devilment, "The Flange is just a huge device for absorbing FTL momentum, Daddy, as I suppose you know, don't you? Isn't it, Murrag?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Her mother leaned forward and slapped her hard across the wrist.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You like to sauce your Dad, don't you? Well, take that! And it's no good coming crying to me about it. It's your fault for being so saucy."</p>

  <p class="block_17">But Fay had no intention of going crying to her mother. Bursting into tears, she flung down her spoon and fork and dashed upstairs, howling. A moment later her bedroom door slammed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Serves her right" Tes muttered.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You be quiet too,"' her mother said angrily.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Never get a peaceful meal now," Dourt said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag Harri said nothing.</p>

  <p class="block_17">After the meal, as the two men went out to work again, Dourt said stiffly, "If you don't mind, Harri, I'd rather you left young Fay alone till we leave here."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh? Why's that?”</p>

  <p class="block_17">The older man thrust him a suspicious glance, then looked away. "Because she's my daughter and I say so."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Can't you give me a reason?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">A dying bird lay in the yard. Birds were as scarce as gold nuggets on Tandy Two. This one must have been overcome by the fumes generated in the previous day's entry. Its wings fluttered pitifully as the men approached. Dourt kicked it to one side.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"If you must know—because she's getting mad on the Flange. Flange, Flange, Flange, that's all we hear from the kid! She didn't know or care a thing about it till this year, when you started telling her all about it. You're worse than Captain Roge when he calls, and he has an excuse because he works on the damn thing. So you keep quiet in the future. Bes and me will leave here with no regrets. Tes doesn't care either way. But we don't want Fay to keep thinking about this place and upsetting herself, thinking Droxy isn't her proper home, which it's going to be."</p>

  <p class="block_17">This was a long speech for Dourt. The reasons he gave were good enough, but irritation made Murrag ask, "Did Mrs. Dourt get you to speak to me about this?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dourt stopped by the garage. He swung around and looked Murrag up and down, anger in his eye.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You've been with me in Region Six nigh on four years, Harri. I was the man who gave you work when you wanted it, though I had not much need of you, nor much to pay you with. You've worked hard, I don't deny—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I can't see—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm talking, aren't I? When you came here you said you were—what was it—'in revolt against ultra-urbanized planets,' you said you were a poet or something; you said—heck, you said a lot of stuff, dressed up in fine phrases. Remember you used to keep me and Bes up half the night listening sometimes, until we saw it was all just talk!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Look here, if you're—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">The farmer bunched his fists and stuck out his lower lip.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You listen to me for a change. I've been wanting to say this for a long time. Poet indeed! We weren't taken in by your blather, you know. And luckily it had no effect on our Tes either. She's more like me than her sister—she's a quiet sensible girl. But Fay is a baby. She's silly as yet, and we reckon you're having a bad influence on her—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"All right, you've had your say. Now I'll have mine. Leaving aside the question of whether you and your wife can understand any concept you weren't born with—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You be careful now, Harri, what you're saying about Bes. I'm on to you! I'm not so daft as you think. Let me tell you Bes has had about enough of you giving her the glad eye and making passes at her as if she was just some—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"By God!" Murrag exploded in anger. "She tells you that? The boot's on the other foot by a long chalk, and you'd better get that clear right away. If you think I'd touch—if I'd lay a hand—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">The mere thought of it took the edge off Murrag's wrath. It had the opposite effect on Dourt. He swung his left fist hard at Murrag's jaw. Murrag blocked it with his right forearm and counterattacked with his left. He caught Dourt glancingly on the ear as the farmer kicked out at him. Unable to step back in time, Murrag grabbed the steel-studded boot and wrenched it upward.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dourt staggered back and fell heavily to the ground.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag stood over him, all fury gone.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"If I had known how much you resented me all these years," he said miserably, staring down at his employer's face, "I'd not have stayed here. Don't worry, I'll say no more to Fay. Now let's go and get the tractors out, unless you want to sack me on the spot—and that's entirely up to you."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As he helped the older man to his feet, Dourt muttered shamefacedly, "I've not resented you, man, you know that perfectly well."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Then they got the tractors out in silence.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">The result of Dourt's fall was what he termed a "bad back." He was—and when he said it, he spoke with an air of surprise more appropriate to a discovery than cliche—not as young as he was. For a day or so he sat gloomily indoors by his CV, letting Murrag do the outside work, and brooding over his lot.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tandy Two is a harder satellite to take than it seems at first—I know that after two five-year spells of duty on it. The density of its composition gives it a gravity of 1.35 Gs. And the fortnightly time hop when the FTLs enter takes a psychological toll. In the big towns, like Touchdown and Blerion, civilization can compensate for these disadvantages. On the scattered sheep stations there are no compensations.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Moreover, Col Dourt had found his farming far less profitable than it had looked on paper from Droxy fourteen years ago. Tandy Two offered good grazing in a stellar sector full of ready-made mutton markets—twenty hundred over-urbanized planets within twice twenty light years. But his costs had been stiff, the costs of transport above all, and now he counted himself lucky to be able to get away with enough credits saved to buy a small shop on his old home planet. As it was, margins were narrow: he was reckoning on the sale of farm and stock to buy passage home for himself and his family.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Much of this I heard on my periodic tours through Region Six, when I generally managed a visit to the Dourts. I heard it all again the next time I called, thirteen days after the scuflle between Dourt and Murrag.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I looked in to see Bes, and found Dourt himself, sitting by a fire, looking surly. He had returned to work and wrenched his back again, and was having to rest it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's the first time I've ever known you to be off work. Cheer up, you've only got a week to go before you'll be making tracks for home," I said, removing my coat.</p>

  <p class="block_17">My truck was outside. Though only half a mile away by hill paths, the unit to which I was attached was at least ten miles off by the circuitous track around the mountains.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Look how long the flaming journey back to Droxy takes when we do get off from Touchdown," he complained. "But with all my family I can't afford to travel FTL."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He spoke as if the FTL ships were my responsibility, which in a sense they were.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Even STLs are fast enough to make the subjective time of the journey no more than three or four months."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't start explaining," he said. He waved his hand, dismissing the subject. "You know I'm only a simple farmer. I don't grasp all that technical stuff about subjective time. I just want to get home."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The two girls Fay and Tes came in after finishing their CV lessons. Tes was preparing lunch; eyeing me warily—she was a mistrustful creature—she told me that her mother was out helping Murrag with the flocks. Both girls came over to the farmer to join in the discussion; I coaxed Fay up onto my knee.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She wanted the whole business of how they would get home explained to her. "You're a Flange maintenance officer, Captain Roge," she said. "Tell me all about it, and then I'll tell Daddy so's he can understand."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You don't have to understand," her father said. "We just take a ship that'll get us there eventually. That's all there is to it, thank God. The likes of us don't need to bother our heads about the technicalities."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I want to know" Fay replied.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's good for us to listen," Tes said, "though <i>I</i> understand it all already. A child could understand it."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm a child and I don't understand it," her sister said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The universe is full of civilized planets, and in a week's time you're all going to hop from one such to another such," I began. And as I sought for simple words and vivid pictures to put my explanation across to them, the wonder of the universe overcame me as if for a moment I too was a child.</p>

  <p class="block_17">For the galaxy has grown up into a great and predominantly peaceful unit. Crime survives, but does not flourish. Evil lives, but knowledge keeps pace with it and fights it. Man prospers and grows kindlier rather than otherwise. Certainly our old vices are as green as ever, but we have devised sociological systems that contain them better than was the case in earlier eras.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Starships are our Starswarm's main connecting links.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Bridging all but the lesser distances are the FTL ships, traveling in superuniverses at multiple-light velocities. Bridging the lesser distances go the STLs, the slower-than-light ships. The two sorts of travel are, like planetary economies, interdependent.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The FTL ship, that ultimate miracle of technology, has one disadvantage: it moves—as far as the "normal" universe is concerned—at only two speeds: faster than light and stationary.</p>

  <p class="block_17">An FTL ship has to stop the moment it comes out of phase space and enters the quantitative fields of the normal universe. Hence the need for bodies such as Tandy Two, spread throughout the galaxy; they are the braking planets, or satellites.</p>

  <p class="block_17">An FTL cannot "stop" in space. Instead, its velocities are absorbed by the braking planets or, more accurately, by the impetus-absorbers of the Flanges that girdle such planets. The FTLs burst in and are reduced to zero velocity within a time limit of about 200 milliseconds—in which time they have circuited the Flange, gone completely around the planet, one and a half times.</p>

  <p class="block_17">STLs or mattermitters then disperse the passengers to local star systems, much in the way that stratoliners land travelers who then disperse to nearby points by helicab.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Though STLs are slow, relativistic time contractions shorten the subjective journeys in them to tolerable limits of weeks or days.</p>

  <p class="block_17">So the universe ticks; not perfectly, but workably.</p>

  <p class="block_17">And this was what I told Dourt and his daughters.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Well, I'd better go and finish getting your dinner, Daddy," Tes said, after a pause.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He patted her bottom and chuckled with approval. "That's it, girl," he said. "Food's more in our line than all this relativistic stuff. Give me a lamb cutlet any day."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I had no answer. Nor had Fay, though I saw by her face that she was still thinking over what I had said, as she slid off my knee to go and help Tes. How much did it mean to her? How much does it all mean to any of us? Though Dourt had little time for theory, I also relished the thought of the lamb cutlet.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Before the food was ready, I took a turn outside with the farmer, who used his stick as support.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You'll miss this view," I said, gazing over the great mysterious body of Tandy whose contours were clad in green, freckled here and there with sheep. I must admit it, I am fonder of the beauties of women than of landscape; for all that, the prospect was fine. In the voluptuous downward curve between two hills, Tandy the primary was setting. Even by daylight the banded and beautiful reds swirling over its oblate surface were impressive.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dourt looked about him, sniffing, admitting nothing. He appeared not to have heard what I said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">“Rain coming up from somewhere," he observed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In my turn I ignored him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You'll miss this view back on Earth," I repeated.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The view!" Dourt exclaimed and laughed. "I'm not a clever man like you and young Murrag, Captain; I get simple satisfaction out of simple things, like being in the place where I was born."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Although I happened to know he was born eight layers under the skyport in Burming, a Droxian manufacturing city, Where they still metered your ration of fresh air, I made no answer. All he meant was that he valued his personal illusions, and there I was with him all the way. Convictions or illusions: what matter if all conviction is illusion, so long as we hang onto it? You would never shift Dourt from his, fool though he was in many ways.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I could never get under his skin as surely as I could with some people—Murrag, for instance, a more complicated creature altogether; but often the simplest person has a sort of characterless opacity about him. So it seemed with Dourt, and if I have drawn him flat and lumpy here, that was how I experienced him then.</p>

  <p class="block_17">To make talk between us, for his silence made me uneasy, I asked after Murrag.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dourt had little to say. Instead he pointed with his stick to a tracked vehicle bumping toward us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That'll be Murrag with Bes now, coming home for a bit of grub," he said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He was mistaken. When the tractor drew nearer, we saw that only Bes was inside it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As we strolled forward, she drove around the covered pens and pulled up beside us. Her face was flushed, and, I thought, angry looking, but she smiled when she saw me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Hullo, Captain Roge!" She climbed down and clasped my hand briefly. "I was forgetting we'd be having your company today. Nice to see a strange face, though I'd hardly call yours that." She turned straight to her husband and said, "We got trouble on Pike's Brow. Two autocollies plunged straight down a crevasse. Murrag's up there with them now trying to get them out."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What were you doing up on Pike's Brow?" he demanded. "I told you to keep number three flock over the other side while I was off work—you know it's tricky on Pike's with all that faulting, you silly woman. Why didn't you do as I told you?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It wouldn't have happened if my throat mike hadn't jammed. I couldn't call the autocollies off before they went down the hole."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't make excuses. I can't take a day off without something going wrong. I—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You've had six days off already, Col Dourt, so shut your mouth—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How's Harri managing?" I asked, thinking an interruption was necessary.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Mrs. Dourt flashed me a look of gratitude. "He's trying to get down the crevasse after the autocollies. Trouble is, they're still going and won't answer to orders, so they're working themselves down deeper and deeper. That's why I came back here, to switch off the juice; they work on maser-beamed power, you know."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I heard Dourt's teeth grind. "Then buck up and switch off, woman, before the creatures ruin themselves! You know they cost money. What're you waiting for?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What? For some old fool to stop arguing with me, of course. Let me by."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She marched past us, an aggressive woman, rather plain, and yet to my taste pleasing, as though the thickness of her body bore some direct if mysterious relationship to the adversities of life. Going into the control shed, she killed the power and then came back to where we stood.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'll come with you, Mrs. Dourt, and see what I can do to help," I said. "I don't need to get back to my outfit for another hour.'"</p>

  <p class="block_17">A look of understanding moved across her face, and I climbed onto the tractor with her after a brief nod to Dourt.</p>

  <p class="block_17">There was some justification for this. If the situation was as she said it was, then the matter was one of urgency—the next FTL ship was due in under four hours, and forty thousand sheep had to be herded under lock and key before that. Had to be: or darkness would be on them, they would stampede and kill or injure themselves on the rocky slopes, and Dourt's hard-earned savings would be wiped out . . . that is, if the situation was as Bes said it was.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When we were out of sight of old Dourt and the farm, Bes stopped the tractor. We looked at each other. My whole system changed gear as we saw the greed in each other's eyes.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How much of this story is a lie to get me alone and at your mercy?" I asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She put her hard broad hand over mine. "None of it, Vasko.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We'll have to shift back to Murrag as soon as possible, if he hasn't already broken his neck down that crevasse. But with Col hanging about the house, I couldn't have seen you alone if this opportunity hadn't turned up—and this'll be our last I meeting, won't it?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Unless you change your mind and don't go to Droxy with him next week."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You know I can't do that, Vasko."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I did know. I was safe. Not to put too fine a point on it, she'd have been a nuisance if she had stayed for my sake. There were dozens of women like Bes Dourt—one on nearly every hill farm I visited, bored, lonely, willing, only too happy to indulge in an affair with a Flange maintenance official. It was not as if I loved her.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Then we'll make it really good this last time," I said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">And there was the greed again, plain and undisguised and sweet. We almost fell out onto the grass. That's how these things should be: raw, unglamorized. That's the way it must be for me. Bes and I never made love. We coupled.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Afterward, when we came to our senses, we were aware that we had been longer than we should have been. Scrambling back into the tractor, we headed-fast and bumpy for Pike's Brow.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I hope Murrag's all right," I muttered, glancing at my arm watch.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She neither liked nor understood my perpetual interest in Murrag Harri.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He's queer!" she sneered.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I didn't ask her to elaborate. I had heard it before, and the pattern behind it was obvious enough: Murrag disliked her hungry advances—and why not? She was plain, solid, coarse .... No, I do myself no justice saying all this, for Bes had a pure peasant honesty that in my eyes excused everything—or so I told myself.</p>

  <p class="block_17">At first when Murrag arrived at Dourt's farm, I had been jealous, afraid that he would spoil my innocent little game. When it was clear he would do no such thing, I grew interested in him for his own involved sake. Sometimes this had caused trouble between Bes and me—but enough of this; I am trying to tell Murrag's tale, not my own. If I digress, well, one life is very much tangled with the next.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We must have created some sort of a speed record to the foot of Pike's Brow. Then the terrain became so steep that: we had to halt, leave the tractor, and go the rest of the way on foot.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Bending our backs, we climbed. Sheep moved reluctantly out of our path, eyeing us with that asinine division of feature that marks a Tandy sheep's face—all rabbity and timid about the eyes and nose, as arrogant as a camel about the lower lip.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Rain came on us with the unexpectedness it reserves for Region Six, as if a giant over the hump of the mountains had suddenly emptied his largest bucket across our path. I remembered Dourt's forecast as I turned up my collar. Still we climbed, watching little rivulets form among the short blades under our boots. I began to wish I hadn't volunteered for this.</p>

  <p class="block_17">At last we reached the crevasse. We scrambled along by its side toward the point where Murrag had climbed over into it, a point marked by the two Hve dogs. Hoc and Pedo, who sat patiently in the rain, barking at our approach.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The downpour was lessening. We stood, pulled our backbones painfully upright, and breathed the damp air deep before bothering about Murrag.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He was some twenty feet down into the crack, where it was so narrow that he could rest with his back on one side and his feet on the other. He was drenched from the water pouring over the edge; it splashed past him and gargled down into a ribbon of a stream about thirty feet beneath his boots.</p>

  <p class="block_17">One of the autocollies was wedged beside him, covered by mud. The other lay a short distance away and a little lower down, overturned but seemingly unharmed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I noted the expression of Murrag's face. It was blank; he seemed to gaze into nothing, ignoring the rivulets that splashed around him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Murrag!" Bes called sharply. "Wake up. We're back."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He looked up at us. "Hello," he said. "Hello, Vasko! I was just communing with the great earth mother. She's really swallowed me .... It's funny, stuck down here in a fissure ... like climbing between the lips of a whale."</p>

  <p class="block_17">And there would have been more like that! Generally I had patience with his curious fancies, enjoyed them even, but not at such a moment, not with Bes standing there sneering, and the water running down my back, and a stitch in my side, and the time against us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's raining," I reminded him. "In case you didn't notice, we're all wet through. For God's sake, stir yourself."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He seemed to pull himself together, dashing wet hair I ck from his face. Peering upward rather stupidly, as if he were a fish, he said, "Fine day for mountaineering, isn't it? If we're not careful, the earth under this autocollie will crumble and the machine may get wedged or damaged. As it is, it is still in working order. Fling me the rope down, Bes. You and Vasko can haul it up while I steady it."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She stared blankly into my face. "Damn it, I left the rope back in the tractor," she said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I remembered then. She'd unhooked it from her waist when we lay on the grass and in her haste had not bothered to tie it on again later, tossing it instead into the back of the vehicle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"For God's sake go and get it then," Murrag shouted impatiently, suddenly realizing how long he had waited. "I can't stay down here much longer."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Again Bes looked at me. I gazed away down at my muddy boots.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Go and get it for me, Vasko," she urged.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm out of breath," I said, "I've got the stitch."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Damn you!" she said. She started off down the hillside again without another word.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag looked sharply up at me; I did not return his stare.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It took her twenty-five minutes to return with the rope. In that time, the rain cleared entirely. I squatted by Pedo and Hoc, gazing over the dull and tumbled terrain. Murrag and I did not speak to each other.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The best part of another hour passed before we three bedraggled creatures had managed to haul the autocollies up safely. We could have done the job in half the time, had we not been so careful to preserve them from harm; we all knew the balance of the Dourt finances, and an autocollie can cost anything from twenty percentages to five parapounds.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Panting, I looked at my arm watch.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In two hours less six minutes the next FTL was due for entry on Tandy Two. It was past the time I should have reported back to my unit for duty.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I told Murrag and Bes that I must be going—told them curtly, for after missing my lunch, getting a soaking, and nearly wrenching my arms off rescuing the dogs, I was none too sweet-humored.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You can't leave us now, Vasko," Murrag said. "The whole flock's in jeopardy, and not only this lot on the Brow. We've got to have every sheep under cover in two hours—and first of all someone must go back to the farm and switch the beami on again to get the dogs going. We need your help still."</p>

  <p class="block_17">His eyes were as appealing as Bes's.</p>

  <p class="block_17">God, I thought, the way some people need people! He has his emotional requirements just as she has her physical ones. Hers are crashingly simple, his I don't understand; once these autocollie dogs were running again, they would see the sheep home in no time, without help.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Right then, I could not think of two people I would less like to be stuck on a mountain with. But all I said was, "I'm a maintenance officer, Murrag, not a shepherd. I've made myself late for duty as it is. Since my truck's at the farm, I'll have to go back to collect it, so when I get there I'll tell Col to beam the juice to you—but from then on you're on your own."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As I turned to go, Bes put her hand on my wrist. When I swung around on her, I saw her flinch from my expression. "You can't just ditch us like this, Vasko," she said. "I'm ditching no one. I helped you drag the 'collies out, didn't I? I've got a job to do, and I'll be listed for reporting back late as it is. Now let me go." She dropped my hand.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I made off down the slope at a slow trot, digging in my heels as I went. Now and again I slipped, falling back on the wet grass. Before I got to the level, I saw another tractor approaching. Dourt was in it. He yelled to me as we drew nearer. "I came to see what you lot were doing all this time. You've been taking so long I thought you'd all fallen down the hole with the 'collies."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Briefly I told him what was happening, while he climbed slowly out of the tractor, clutching his back.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm borrowing Bes's tractor to go back and switch on the juice, so that the autos can start herding as soon as possible,'" I finished.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He fell to cursing, saying he was going to lose all his livestock, that they could never be driven under cover before the FTL arrived. I tried to reassure him before going over to the other vehicle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As I climbed in he said, "When you get there, tell Tes to come back here with the tractor. She can drive well enough, and we'll need her help. The more hands here the better. And tell her to bring the signal pistols. They'll get the sheep moving."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And Fay?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"She'd only be in the way."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Giving him a wave, I stood on the acceleration and rattled back to the farm. By now the sun was bright and the sky free of cloud, which did not stop my boots from squelching or my clothes from clinging to me like wet wallpaper.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The moment I reached the farm buildings I marched into the control shed, crossed to the appropriate board, and pushed the rheostat over. Power began its ancient song, the hum of content that sounds perpetually as if it is ascending the scale. Up on the pastures, the electronic dogs would be leaping into activity.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Everything appeared in order, though Col Dourt was not a man to keep his equipment spotless—and I reflected, not for the first time that day, that if he had cared to lay out an extra twenty parapounds or so he could have had switchboard-to-flock communication, which would have saved him valuable time on a day like this.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Well, it was not my concern.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In the living-eating-cooking complex, Tes was alone. She stood in her slip, cutting out a dress for Droxy wear, and I surveyed her; she was developing well.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As usual, she seemed displeased to see me—baffling creatures, adolescent girls; you never know whether they are acting or not. I gave her her father's orders and told her to get out to Pike's Brow as soon as she could.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And Where's Fay?" I asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's none of your business. Captain Roge."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As if she felt this was a bit too sharp, she added, "And anyhow I don't know. This is one of my great not-knowing days."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I sniffed. I was in a hurry, and it was, as she said, none of my business now, although I would dearly have liked a farewell word with the younger girl. Nodding to Tes, I squelched out of the building, got into the maintenance truck, and began speeding back to my unit around the other side of the mountains. To perdition with all Dourts!</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag used to say that there wasn't a more interesting job than mine on all Tandy. Though he was prepared to talk for hours about his feelings—"my Tandian tenebrosities," he sometimes called them—he was equally prepared to listen for hours while I explained in minute detail the working of the Flange and the problems of repair it posed. He learned from me any facts he filtered on to Fay.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Maintaining the Flange is a costly and complicated business, and would be even more so had we not costly and complicated machines with which to operate. Between FTL arrivals, my unit works ceaselessly over the strip—testing, checking, replacing, making good.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The complex nature of the Flange necessitates this.</p>

  <p class="block_17">To start with, there is the BGL—the Bonfiglioll Geogravitic Layer—marked by tall pylons, along the north of the Flange, which maintains all of Tandy Two's atmosphere within its stress; were this to contract more than a minimum leakage, the lives of everyone on the planet would be in jeopardy.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Before the BGL comes the "fence," which prevents any creature from entering the Flange zone; after it come our equipment stores, bunkers, etc., before you get to the actual twelve-mile-wide Flange itself.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Flange is a huge shock absorber, three stories deep, girdling the planet. It has to absorb the biggest man-made shock of all time, though it is a delicate instrument with an upper surface of free-grooved pyr-glass needles. Its functioning depends first and foremost on the taubesi thermocouple, of which there is one to every square millimeter of surface; these detect an FTL ship before it re-enters normal space and activate the rest of the system immediately. The rest of the system is, briefly, an inertia vacuum. The FTL ship never actually makes contact with the Flange surface, of course, but its detectors mesh with the inertials and transfer velocities, stopping it in milliseconds—the figure varies according to planetary and ship's mass, but for Tandy Two it is generally in the order of 201.5 milliseconds.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The whole Flange is activated—switched on section by section of its entire twenty-five thousand miles length—two hours before an FTL ship arrives (only the computers beneath the strip know precisely when the starship will materialize from phase space). At that time, the various maintenance units give the whole system a final check, and the needlelike surface of the Flange looks first one way and then another, like stroked fur, as it searches for the breakthrough point. I should have been hack for that event.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I had come down to the valleys by now. Over to my left ran the graceful BGL pylons, with the Flange itself behind, already stretching itself like a self-activated rubber sheet; beyond it burned the dead half of Tandy, sealed off in vacuum, bleached dust-white in the sun. Less than a mile remained between me and the unit post. Then I saw Fay.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Her blue dress showed clearly against the tawny ground. She was several hundred yards ahead of me, not looking in my direction and running directly toward the electrified "fence" that guards the BGL and the Flange itself.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Fay!" I yelled. "Come back!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Instinctive stuff; I was enclosed in the truck; had she heard my cry it would only have speeded her on her way.</p>

  <p class="block_17">This was her last chance to see an FTL ship enter before she went back to Droxy. The absence of her father and mother had given her the chance to slip out, so she had taken it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Fay!" I yelled as I drove, letting my lungs shout, because in my fear I could not stop them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The silence was built of two components, an ordinary strand fence with a mild shock to keep sheep away, and then, some yards beyond, a trellis of high voltage designed simply and crudely to kill. Warning notices ran all the way between the two fences, one every three hundred and fifty yards— 125,714 of them right around the planet.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She dived through the strand fence without touching it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Now I was level with her. Seeing me, she began running parallel between the two fences. Beyond her the eyes of the needles of the Flange turned first this way then that, restless and expectant.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I jumped from the truck before it stopped moving.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You’ll get killed, Fay!" I bellowed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She turned then, her face half mischievous, half scared. She was running off-course toward the second fence as she turned. She called something to me—I could not make out, still cannot make out, what.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As I ducked under the sheep strand after her, she hit the other fence.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Fay! Ah, my Fay, my own sweet freeborn daughter! She was outlined in bright light, she was black as a cinder, the universe screamed and yapped like a dying dog. My face hit the dust shrieking as I fell. Noise, death, heat, slapped me down.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Then there was mind-devouring silence.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Peace rolled down like a steamroller, flattening everything, the eternal hush of damnation into which I wept as if the universe were a pocket handkerchief for my grief.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Fay, oh Fay, my own child!</p>

  <p class="block_17">Beyond the BGL, safe in vacuum, the Flange peered toward the heavens, twisting its spiked eyes. I rolled in the blistered dust without comprehension.</p>

  <p class="block_17">How long I lay there I have no idea.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Eventually the alarms roused me. They washed around me and through me until they, too, were gone, and the silence came back. When my hearing returned, I heard a throbbing in the silence. At first I could not place it, had no wish to place it, but at last I sat up and realized that the motor of my truck was still patiently turning over. I stood up shakily. The ill-coordinated action brought a measure of intelligence back to my system.</p>

  <p class="block_17">All I knew was that I had to return to the farm and tell Bes what had happened. Everything else was forgotten, even that the FTL ship was due at any time.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I got back somehow under the sheep fence, and into the cab. Somehow I kicked in the gears, and we lurched into action. Fay, Fay, Fay, my blood kept saying.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As I steered away from the Flange, from the burned ground to grass again, a figure presented itself before me. Blankly I stopped and climbed out to meet it, hardly knowing what I did.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It was Murrag, waving his arms like one possessed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Thanks to your aid we got the flocks under cover in time," he said. "So I came down here to see the FTL entry. You know, for me to see an entry—well, it's like watching creation."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He stopped, eyeing me, his face full of a private emotion.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's like the creation, is it?" I said dumbly. My mouth felt puffy. Fay, Fay, Fay.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Vasko, we've always been friends, so I don't have to mind what I say to you. You know that this event once a fortnight—it's the ultimate excitement for me. I mean . . . well, even something like sex palls beside watching an FTL entry."</p>

  <p class="block_17">In the state I was in I could not grasp what he was saying. It came back to me long after, like finding a private letter behind the wainscoting of an empty house.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And I've got the image of Tandy Two I was after, Vasko." His eyes were alight, full of some inner fire. "Tandy's a woman—"</p>

  <p class="block_17">There was no warning. The FTL ship entered.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Cerenkov radiations belched outward, distorting our vision. For a second Murrag and I were embedded in amber. Tandy was girdled in a noose of flame, most of which expanded south safely into vacuum. Then the giant fist of impetus reaction struck us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The sun plunged across the sky like a frightened horse. As we fell, day turned to night.</p>

  <p class="block_17">For one of those long minutes that seem a small eternity, I lay on the ground with Murrag half on top of me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He moved before I did. When it penetrated my mind that he was slipping a fume mask on, I automatically did the same; without thinking, I had carried my mask from the vehicle with me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He had switched on a flashlight. It lay on the ground as we sprouted bug-eyed jumbo faces, and splashed a great caricature of us up the mountainside. In the sky, the planet Tandy appeared, near full and bright, a phantom. As ever, it was impossible to believe it was not our moon rather than vice versa; facts have no power against the imagination.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Sitting there stupidly, I heard the words of an old poet scatter through my head, half of his verse missing.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">O, moon of my delight who know'st no wane.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Something something once again. </p>

  <p class="block_17">How oft hereafter rising shall she look </p>

  <p class="block_17">Through this same garden after me—in vain!</p>

  <p class="block_17"></p>

  <p class="block_17">But I had no time to connect up the missing words; if I had thought of it, I preferred it that way, thus emphasizing my sense of loss. But no rational thought came.</p>

  <p class="block_17">All that came was the clash of two nightmares, Murrag's and mine. It seemed that I kept crying "Fay is dead!" and that he kept crying "Tandy Two's a woman!" We were fighting, struggling together while the ground steamed, I hating him because he did not care where I had expected him to care, he hating me because I had spoiled his vigil, ruined his climax.</p>

  <p class="block_17">My mind ran in shapes, not thoughts, until I realized that I had begun the fight. When I went limp, Murrag's fist caught me between the eyes.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I do not have to say what I felt then, slumped on the ground—the place I hated and Murrag loved—for this is supposed to be his story, not mine, although I have become entangled in it in the same directionless way I became entangled in Bes's life.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Murrag—you have to say it—could not feel like ordinary people. When I heard from him again, he did not even mention Fay; he had only used her to talk to about his obsession.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When, a week later, the STL ship Monteith departed for Droxy from Tandy, Col, Bes, and Tes Dourt traveled in it. So did I. I lay in a bunk in the medical bay, classified under some obscure technical label that meant I was dull of mind and unfit for further service.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Dourts came to see me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They were surprisingly cheerful. After all, they had made their money and were about to begin life anew. Even Bes never referred to Fay; I always said she was hard.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They brought me a letter from Murrag. It was elaborate, overwritten. Wrapped in his own discoveries, he clearly mourned as little for Fay as did the Dourts. His letter, in fact, displayed his usual sensitivity, and his blindness where other humans were concerned. I had no patience with it, though I later reread the final passages (which he has since used in his successful book, <i>To My Undeniable Tandy</i>).</p>

  <p class="block_17">". . . Yilmoff's fifty-fourth era classic. Theory of Images, reveals how settings can hold deep psychic significances for men; we acquire early an Experience of place. When a planet exists with as distinct a personality—for the term in context is no exaggeration—as Tandy Two's, the significance is increased, the effect on the psyche deepened.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I declare myself to be in love, in the true psychological sense of the word, with Tandy. She is my needful feminine, dwelling in my mind, filling it to the exclusion of others.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"So I give you my true portrait image of her: the planet-head of a girl, all sweet, rich hair north, but the south face a skull, and bound round her brow a ribbon of flame. This is the portrait of my terrible lover."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Make of this what you will. Crazy? I think not.</p>
