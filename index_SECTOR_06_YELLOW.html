 <br>

  <p class="block_21">In a short time, Banya Ban will not have to fight alone. They have agreed to accept help from Iron Arm, the force that most nearly represents an interstellar police.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Assistance sent over such large distances has a habit of arriving years or even generations late. Unfortunately the most speedy means of transportation cannot operate over large distances. The matter transmitters that convey us so easily from one point on a globe to another are ineffective between widely spaced stars.</p>

  <p class="block_22">The reason for this is, of course, that the image at the receiving end has to be an exact replica of the article transmitted. Interstellar interference is such that the signal, even when masered, is not reliable over a distance greater than eighty light years.</p>

  <p class="block_22">During the early days of mattermitters, before this factor was fully understood, there were many accidents; a man sent across a hundred light years where cosmic activity is high can emerge from the receiver as so many kilos of shredded protein. In Starswarm, where we are accustomed to think in terms of thousands of light years, this factor has imposed severe limitations.</p>

  <p class="block_22">In certain sectors where the suns are set closely and the enormous expense of the mattermitters can thus be justified, they are used. One such region lies in the thickly swarming worlds of Sector Yellow bordering the Rift. Sector Yellow lies at the hinge between the two main arms of Starswarm, sectors Diamond and Green.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Although it is on an important trade route, Sector Yellow has a poor reputation and is avoided by the general run of humanity, though the outcasts of many societies have found a home there. It is in Sector Yellow that we find the greatest concentration of nonhuman phyla. Not only are they often unreliable, but no great dependency can be placed on the physical laws of the worlds on which they live.</p>

  <p class="block_22">All this is particularly true of Smith's Burst, the most notable intragalactic nebula of the region. So it is appropriate, if regrettable, that the narrative that follows should also be unreliable.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Before man became homo interstellar, traveler^ tales were notoriously filled with exaggeration. This narrative appears to be in the tradition.</p>

  <p class="block_22">We include it because it gives a vivid glimpse of a chaotic part of our universe. The text has been somewhat abridged and some indecencies removed. It is a firsthand account of the adventures of one Jami Lancelo Lowther on the Planet Glumpalt in the Hybrid Cluster of Smith's Burst.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Internal evidence forces us to question some of the incidents related. This much, however, we know: a financier called Lowther made an illegal mattermitter journey, and a planet called Glumpalt exists, on which the Black Sun still rises.</p>

    <br/>
  <br>
<br/>
  <br>

  <p class="block_15">I</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">A man must suffer many moments of indignity in his life, but see to it that you are never put up for sale as I was.</p>

  <p class="block_17">There I stood, propped up by two shapeless roughs, on an auction platform. I had barely recovered consciousness when [ saw below me a crowd yelling prices. It was a nightmare, for the freaks around me could only have issued from a doubled sleep.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The auctioneer had the biggest head of them all. Supported ess by his puny body than by four stalks, which had the power Df movement like thin legs, the head itself was covered with lair, through bald patches of which glittered eyes and orifices. He was at once ludicrous and frightening.</p>

  <p class="block_17">All the people gathered around this creature were as ugly m: as fantastic. None of them had the decency to own one normal head or one ordinary pair of hands. No two were ilike, though many were similar. Each one had something antastic about him: jaws or claws or maws or paws, eyes or mtennae or tails.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Surveying this repellent multitude, I knew I was far from »nity and civilization and the law of Starswarm. I guessed It once that I was on one of the benighted planets in Smith's Burst.</p>

  <p class="block_17">If the crowd did not confirm this supposition, my surroundings did. The town, which I shall describe more fully later, was a ramshackle series of fortresses and villages set on little islands about which lapped a filthy lake. The name of this own I discovered was Ongustura, although the superstitious rabble was reluctant to name names.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The lake was circled by mountains, featureless and unwelcoming. Cloud obscured most of the sky, but the part hat was clear glittered with many points of light. I knew I was somewhere where the stars lay thickly.</p>

  <p class="block_17">All this I took in before being sold.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Let's have a rope around you, creature, and neither of IS will come to harm," my purchaser said to me, leading me from the platform. In my bewilderment I noticed little, but thought that he seemed more comely than his fellows, lentil later observation showed that what I thought was his lead was his posterior; his face was set in what I took to be us belly.</p>

  <p class="block_17">For all that, it was a joy to hear him speak Galingua. The est of the speech had been in some local tongue that meant nothing to me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">'Heaven be praised that you are civilized, sir "</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Silence, you freak," he growled, interrupting me, "or I'll have your tongue tied around your wrist."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The confusion in my mind and about me was such that it took a while to realize that I was in a market square. Among that ugly mob were many who rode and many who were ridden upon, yet between one and the other there was little to choose. My master—T must call him such—climbed onto a thing like a porpoise, which talked; I was dragged up behind him, he jerked the rein, and we were off.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Mind to right! Mind to the left!" my master called, as we jostled along. We took a street that sloped down into the waters of the lake. The porpoise-thing nosed into it and bore us to another island, getting us rather wet in the process. Heaving us along another street, it stopped before a tall, dirty building.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We dismounted. My master and the porpoise argued in the local tongue until the former produced some coins as big as a saucer, which the creature slipped into a pocket in his saddle before moving off. I was led into the building.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Gloom and squalor surrounded us. May I be preserved from describing any structure on that foul globe! Its owner had once built a single room, covering it with a sloping roof to fend off the rains. When he needed more space, he built another room nearby, connecting them with a covered way. Over the years he had required more and more rooms as he turned his abode into a lodging house. Since no more space was available for him horizontally, he had been forced to build upward—in the most casual manner possible, for the cell (it was no more) to which my master and I ascended was made of sloping tile underfoot. It had once been the roof of the second-story room below; no one had seen fit to alter it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">There we squatted uncomfortably, my master on a pile of rags I avoided for their smell's sake.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Sleep, you execrable example of protoplasm!" he cried to me, tugging at the rope around my neck. "Sleep, for in only two dervs you and I set out for Anthropophagi Land. Rest while you can."</p>

  <p class="block_17">A derv was a fifth part of a day, a day being an awderv (aw meaning five)—but the local day was as uncertain as much else there, and an awderv was simply an arbitary period of about twenty hours.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It seemed sensible to win the confidence of this creature. Were he foolish enough to trust me, my chances of escape would be increased.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I cannot sleep for looking at you," I said. "How beautiful you are, with those massive pincers at the end of your four arms, and that exquisite fringe of green hair—or is it moss?— down the front of your legs."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No two are born alike," he said complacently, as if repeating an ancient saying.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Some are more beautiful than others."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That talk's punishable as heresy here in Ongustura," my master said, lowering his voice. "The law states each fellow is as beautiful as his neighbor."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Then you demonstrate the stupidity of the law."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He was pleased, and by such touches I won him around to a better mood. He soon told me what I had suspected from his mastery of Galingua, that he was a traveler, a trader, moving from one part of the planet to another. The planet was called Glumpalt; he knew it to be in the intragalactic nebula called Smith's Burst; beyond that he was totally ignorant. He had never heard of mattermitters, nor had he ever left this accursed world—nor did he ever wish to.</p>

  <p class="block_17">His name was Thrash Pondo-Pons. He was superstitious like all Glumpaltians and as vain as most of them. He looked and smelled bizarre. He had no manners, education, or friends, except such as he acquired by accident—a fine representative of his entire heterogeneous race. He had many good points, although these took me longer to discover. He was brave, industrious, resolute, and had a peculiarly sweet resigned attitude toward the blows of fate, which fell as liberally on Glumpalt as elsewhere in the cosmos.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Thrash Pondo-Pons was not even remotely human. Many of his characteristics were not human. Yet I got on with him as well as I could have with a human under similar circumstances.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I did not sleep out the two dervs, nor did he. Toward the end of that time we rose and made a meal. My first food on Glumpalt! Realizing I was hungry, I set out to eat as much as I could from the communal trough set before us. Part of the dish was cooked, part raw, part still alive.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Thrash then got his cart ready. It stood behind the lodging house, a complex structure with an iron chassis and a superstructure of wood and canvas. To this, two "horses" were harnessed; one looked something like a caterpillar, one something like an elephant. I was pulled aboard and secured in the back of the cart, and off we started on what was to be a fantastic journey.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When we came to water, we embarked onto a sort of barge, and as we moved among the islands, I had time to observe Ongustura from the back of the cart. With its crazy buildings, it 4vas most like a series of rubbish dumps, for the debris piled up to make houses covered every bit of land. How many people and things lived there could not be computed—but the place swarmed with multiformed life.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Imagine, then, the leap my heart took when I sighted, amid one rubble pile, a great clean snout of polished metal pointing up to the clouds! There stood a space ship, its bulk indicating that it was some kind of star freighter.</p>

  <p class="block_17">My immediate predicament had not blinded me to the possibility that I might be stranded forever on this godforsaken globe. It was so primitive that I had not dared to hope it would be on any space lane.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Whose is the ship?" I called to Thrash.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"TransBurst Traders," he replied. "I came here to sell them skins and carcasses. They'll be off for Acrostic in ten awdervs, the day after the Black Sun sets. It'll be rising in about a week now."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Acrostic! That was the name of a planet I knew. It lay toward the edge of Smith's Burst, beyond the Hybrid Cluster in which Glumpalt belonged. Once on Acrostic, it would be comparatively easy to work back to civilization. I knew now that all my efforts must be bent on escaping from Thrash and getting onto that ship. It was my only hope.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Yet I stayed quiet, for one of Thrash's five eyes was upon me.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_15">II</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">We finally reached the edge of the lake. The cart was trundled ashore, and we began to climb a twisting track that led over the mountains.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A leather halter around my neck, a rope around my waist, I walked beside Thrash as we creaked along.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Let's hope Chance will be with us once we cross the pass," Thrash muttered. "The country is riddled with demons at this time of year. What's more, we shall pass through the realm of the Ungulph of Quilch. He's without mercy to those who come from Ongustura, for he and it are traditional enemies. Fortunately, you should be some protection to me."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How so?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You have the same peculiar outward form—only one head and four main limbs—as the Ungulph's youngest daughter."</p>

  <p class="block_17">On this remark he would not elaborate, growing more withdrawn as we climbed higher. As I stared at him, he grew two shadows.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I found I also had two shadows. Looking up, I saw the clouds liad partly cleared. A pair of suns shone there, one a monstrous pink thing, like a blob of custard, the other a more powerful yellow globe. I have been on planets of binary stars before, and always curse the complications they make in the calendar.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Under their heat, we were sweating profusely by the time pee reached the pass. Behind us, like a series of grimy sand castles in a pool, lay Ongustura. I could still make out the lose of the TransBurst ship.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Checking to see that I was securely tied, Thrash released his steeds from the shafts of the cart. The three of them went nto some sort of magical routine to appease the anger of my local spirits who might be about. They burned reeking :at, danced, sprinkled powder over themselves, and declared jbat danger lay ahead.</p>

  <p class="block_17">While this mumbo jumbo went on, I had time to observe what never ceased to interest me. On Glumpalt, no distinction s made, or can be made, between homo, animal, fish, reptile, or insect. There is only one great miscellaneous class, the individuals of which may have at one and the same time some of the characteristics of man, horse, crab, toad, and grass-lopper. Most individuals could produce by chirps, barks, witters, or twangs one of the many Glumpaltian dialects, rhe only valid difference between Thrash and his steeds was that the steeds had no sort of manual appendages like lands or claws, whereas he had; they were thus condemned to the life of beasts of burden—but in his conversations with them he ignored this distinction.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They finished their magic. We proceeded.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Few landmarks existed on the way ahead. Steadily we covered the miles. The custard sun set behind a wall of cloud, but the day remained bright.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Tell us your history," Thrash said. "And make it amusing so that I and my friends may laugh aloud to scare the demons who beset our route."</p>

  <p class="block_17">So I told him my history. He translated it as I spoke into a Glumpaltian tongue for his friends' enjoyment.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am a financier," I said. "Rather, I am an entrepreneur for a loan company that is not recognized by any Starswarm government. There is a great deal of risk in all our transactions, and consequently our rates are high. I myself am frequently involved with the law in trying to save my company from loss.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Last week I pulled off a considerable deal with the rebel (government of Rolf III. I earned a vacation on New Droxy and planned to travel there by mattermitter. Being at some disagreement with the authorities, I arranged to be broadcast by an illegal beam.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Obviously that beam was not powerful enough. Having to pass through a disturbed region of space like Smith's Burst, it must have been momentarily broken. And in consequence I materialized here!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">They failed to laugh. But from then on I was watched more closely than ever. Thrash took to wearing a great bow over his shoulder; a quiver of brass-tipped arrows hung at his side. This did not encourage me to make a sudden run for freedom. They never let me from their sight even when I fulfilled my natural functions.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Our progress was not rapid. Stopping at villages meant much delay, for an elaborate ritual had to be undergone each time before we entered the ramshackle walls. This was to exorcise wayside demons: we had to be purged of their company before those within the villages allowed us to enter. The ceremony sometimes took a whole derv, or four hours. I was liberally daubed with a stinking white substance made from powdered shell Thrash kept in a silver casket.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In the villages conditions were miasmic. I soon lost track of the road back to Ongustura, for there were many trails leading everywhere. To keep account of time was also impossible. Glumpalt evidently had an erratic orbit. Though I heard no more about the Black Sun for a while, the pink and yellow suns rose and sank in a manner to me quite impredictable.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Thrash had some trouble about the route through the lands of the Ungulph of Quilch; he grew increasingly anxious about the road ahead.</p>

  <p class="block_17">On one occasion, the caterpillar-horse was pulling the cart while Thrash rode on the elephant-horse with me behind him. We came to a many-branched tree by the wayside. Raising his claw. Thrash halted us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Climb up that tree and say if you see anything in the way of landmarks ahead, shoe-shaped one," he ordered, turning tome.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Unbind my hands and I will," I said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't try to escape or I spit you through on an arrow," he warned, untying my wrists.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I climbed the tree until I came to the highest branch that would bear me. Then I stared ahead and began calling loudly and anxiously.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh Lord Thrash!" I bellowed. "Come back! Don't ride away from me so fast and leave me in this desolate place! I shall be lost without you! Come back!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">In puzzlement and anger Thrash called out to me from where he stood below.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Are you out of your senses, monster-man? I am standing still here. I have not moved. Come down at once!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Taking no notice, I still cried out to him not to ride away and leave me, and so I descended the tree. When I got down and faced him, I shook my head and rubbed my eyes, feigning disbelief.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"But I saw you gallop away on your elephant-horse friend!" exclaimed bewilderedly. "You disappeared over that hill, I’ll swear!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">“Rubbish!" he said. "We never moved from this spot. Climb up again and deliver truly of what you see ahead."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Obediently I climbed the tree a second time. A second time I cried out.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Come back, my master! You gallop away so fast! What have I done to deserve such treatment? Oh, come back, come back!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Ignoring his shouts from below, I slid down the trunk and stood before him on the ground.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I never moved," he said. "What's this foolishness?" Then I burst into laughter, seizing one of his claws to show my relief.</p>

  <p class="block_17">“There's a glorious illusion, Lord Thrash. You stayed here, yet from the top of this tree I had a perfect picture of you galloping off at full speed over that nearest hill. How wonderfully comic! I beg you, climb up, climb up and see if you can't see something similar. This is a magic tree, set here for the edification of travelers by benevolent spirits. Climb up and laugh your fill!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">The face on his belly broke into a reluctant smile. Obediently he began to climb the tree. Once he was well in the tree, I limped onto his elephant-horse.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am a great enchanter," I snarled into the thing's ear. Gallop your hardest for the nearest hill or I turn you into a laming faggot on the instant."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He set off with a start that nearly threw me and went as if pursued by devils. Turning, I saw Thrash Pondo-Pons in the top of the tree. He was pointing at me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">“This is in truth a magic tree!" he roared. "I swear it looks 5 if you are galloping off for the nearest hill on my steed. The illusion is complete! Wonderful! Marvelous!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">He shook with laughter, and the tree shook with him. Soon ^e were over the brow of the hill.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_15">III</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">I had got away, but was by no means out of my predicament, n which direction lay Ongustura I knew not. All the food had would not nourish a cockroach; of the local language could pronounce only a few simple words, mostly obscenities, which I had picked up from Thrash on the journey. And s if all this were not enough, both the suns were obviously determined to set at once.</p>

  <p class="block_17">My problems were soon complicated further. The elephant-horse put on the burst of speed one might expect from a creature ridden by a great enchanter. Unfortunately I wall never a great horseman, and an especially fierce jolt flung me from the saddle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Falling in short grass, I sat up in time to see my charger disappear. His flanks had been loaded with paraphernalia; the jolt that dislodged me had also shaken loose a casket of worked silver. It represented my only possession. On opening it, I found it was half-filled with the nauseous crushed-shell | powder, which was worth having, since without it I could not enter any village.</p>

  <p class="block_17">An evening wind blew chill. I stood up and was aware of a „ curious' sensation. One of my legs was lighter than the other. I The ground here was broken, as if by a minor earth fault I Walking to and fro, I discovered that my whole body felt | lighter when over this fault line. No doubt this unaccountable shift in weight was responsible for my fall.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dusk was coming on. Unable to solve the mystery, I took the casket under my arm and stepped forward. After awhile I saw a light ahead, and came to a hamlet inside a wooden I compound.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Now was the time to call to those within that a stranger j sought shelter, and to begin the absurd magical ritual that would render me fit to enter. But the place was oddly silent. I was cold, in no mood to loiter about. The pink sun had been swallowed by the dark hills. Boldly, I pushed through the wooden gate and entered the compound.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The dwellings were the usual motley collection, made of stones or boulders, wood or mud. They huddled about me like so many old cows under blankets. The light I had seen from a distance came from a sort of beacon set in the middle of a "street" to furnish illumination for the hovels nearby.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Nobody stirred. Taking my courage into my hands, for it was growing too cold to be cowardly outdoors, I entered the dwelling into which the most light was cast. Huddled in the room were several Glumpaltians in their usual variety of shapes and sizes. They crouched motionless under rugs or skins, some snoring gently.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I crept into a rear room to seek food. There I found a barrel containing something very like salted water snails. I was debating with my stomach whether I could ever bring myself to eat them when there came the sound of footsteps; in the street. Shrinking into one corner, I saw a fellow enter the house by the door I had used. I say "fellow," but he was; in truth more like a crab, with eyes on stalks and several legs to walk on.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Without hesitation he came through to where I hid, seized the barrel of snails and some other food, and tucked them into the pockets of his mighty coat. It was vexing to see burgled what I had been about to steal, but I made no outcry. If this fellow was one of society's outcasts, I reasoned that he might be of more use to me than the others; and if he was off to a safe refuge with plenty of food, then I could not do better than to follow him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">This I did. The crabman went from hovel to hovel with no care for silence, adding to his load at each stop. Frost crunched beneath his feet. Desperate with cold, I snatched a thick skin off one of the sleepers; he did not stir; probably he was hibernating.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Completing his rounds, the crabman left the hamlet and set off across country at a good pace. I followed, discreetly. The risk of discovery was greater now; a bright moon had risen and was racing across the sky, flooding the country with radiance.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We entered a valley, then climbed again. Around a sharp cliff, an extraordinary sight greeted me. A rainbow curtain hung across the path, reaching from the ground to about ten feet high. I was in time to see the crabman scurry through it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The rainbow was mainly violet, red and blue, the colors subdued but perfectly clear. As I approached, the feeling of lightness again assailed me. It became more and more difficult to plant my feet on the ground or to move forward.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Now I could see that the rainbow sprang from a precipice about ten feet wide. I took a good run and cleared it easily. Landing gently, I was in time to see the crabman vanish into a little house carved in the rock.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Stay and have a word with me!" I cried in Galingua. I did not expect him to understand; I merely wanted to see how he would react. I had a stout stick ready, reckoning I could tip him into the precipice with it if it came to a tussle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I have words for everyone," he replied. It was incredible to believe that this misshapen crab could speak the galaxy's tongue. Forgetting my caution, I went to his door, through which a light shone.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Where did you learn Galingua?" I asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He was rummaging about in an antiquated cupboard, and answered without looking at me, as far as I could see.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am the Interpreter. I speak all languages. There is not a tongue talked on Glumpalt I do not know."</p>

  <p class="block_17">If this were true, I had indeed followed the right fellow.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We could be useful to each other," I said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am useful to no one, unless they can teach me a new language," he said. Now he turned to survey me. He was massive, but his shell looked fragile enough. I mustered as much confidence as possible and closed the door behind me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How many languages are there on Glumpalt?" I asked him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Two thousand and thirty-two, and I speak them all."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Wrong! There are two thousand and thirty-three!" And I began to address him in the language of Rolf III. He was amazed. Finally he said, "We will eat and discuss this. Come, sit down, Flat-eyes; we are friends."</p>

  <p class="block_17">We sat on either side of an upturned tub, on top of which he piled edibles. The -more he talked, the madder I thought him, particularly as he interrupted his talk often to circle the table and me. He told me that learning languages was about all he could do. He had a freak brain; he could learn a whole new language in a week. On Glumpalt there were many languages, each province speaking a different one. So he had been taken on as interpreter at the court of the Ungulph of Quilch.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Eventually he had fallen out with the Ungulph, who had stolen his name and sent him packing. Now he lived a hermit's life without a name, known only as the Interpreter.</p>

  <p class="block_17">At the end of this farrago of facts, when I had eaten as much of the beastly food as I could, I rose.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I was trapped! Sticky threads bound me. When I grasped them, they adhered to my hands. I could not break them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You are my prisoner," he said. "Sit down again. You will remain here for a week, teaching me this dialect you call Rolfial. Then I will let you free again."</p>

  <p class="block_17">From what he then said, I gathered that he was less crab than spider. The threads were spun from his own entrails. When he had circled the table, he had been secretly imprisoning me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I did not despair. The thought of the TransBurst Traders' ship gave impetus to my racing brain.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We are within seven awdervs of Ongustura," I said. "I will happily teach you Rolfial if you will take me there."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I can learn in comfort here."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I cannot teach you here. Your name is taken from you; I have had all my prepositions taken from me. I was on my way to collect them from a magician in Ongustura. If you will take me there, I will teach you everything but the prepositions on the journey, and those you shall willingly have when we arrive."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Who is this magician?" he asked suspiciously.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"His name is Bywithanfrom."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Hm. I will think on it."</p>

  <p class="block_17">So saying, he hauled himself up by a self-made thread to the rafters and dropped into a coma. Despite my discomfort, I f ell asleep over the tub.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When I woke, a pallid morning had dawned, and the Interpreter was up and about. He released me from my bonds, leaving only one long rope around my waist.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We start soon," he said. "I accept your suggestion. We shall go to Ongustura, there to collect your prepositions and complete my mastery of Rolfial."</p>

  <p class="block_17">While he was preparing, I ventured outside. The rope around my middle allowed me to go as far as the precipice. Again a feeling of lightness overcame me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Floating rather than jumping, I launched myself into the gulf. The bottom, muddy and full of stones, offered no explanation for the sensation of weightlessness it gave off. Prodding with a sharp stone, however, I dug into something solid. When I pulled at it, a fragment broke off. It looked like natural chalk.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I dropped it. At once it soared up into the air and headed toward the clouds.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Beside myself with excitement, I filled my pockets with the crumbling stuff. Soon I was so light that I would have taken off myself had I not filled other pockets with ordinary heavy stones.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I ran back into the tawdry hut, in my enthusiasm treating the Interpreter as if he were human. Releasing a chunk of the light stuff, I showed him how it shot up to the ceiling.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's antigravity material, occurring naturally,'" I exclaimed. "You have a fortune at your doorstep; don't you realize it?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">He shook his eyestalks at me in a dreadful way.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This material occurs all over Glumpalt in small veins," he said. "But it is not touched because it is bad magic. You will die if you persist in keeping it.'"</p>

  <p class="block_17">I did persist. When we set out on our journey to Ongustura, my pockets were loaded with the stuff. Only a sack full of stones on my back enabled me to walk in the usual way.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Thinking back over that trek, I can laugh now, for we can make as merry over our own past hardships as over our friends' present ones. It was a mad journey! The way lay along stony tracks and barren hills; we were forever slipping down or climbing up the sides of ravines. The Interpreter on his eight legs had an easy journey; I was often dropping from fatigue.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Yet one or the other of us was talking all the time. The Interpreter imbibed his languages by a Gestalt principle obscure to me; all I had to do was chatter of this and that in Rolfial and he took it in. I cannot tell you how vexing it is, while ascending a steep slope, to have to discourse on, say, the origins of the Starswarm federation, remembering at the same time to omit all prepositions from one's sentences. My cleverness imposed a sore task on me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">After his fashion, the Interpreter was no bad companion. Often I said something that touched off a train of thought he pursued vocally for hours. When on the subject of the creation of Glumpalt, he told me many things I wanted to know.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The nebula you call Smith's Burst," he said, "was formed by the collision of two clouds of cosmic gas, one of them composed of antimatter. This little planet condensed out of the resultant mixture. What you call antigrav material, that chalky stuff, is decayed AM that, when freed from its surroundings, is violently repelled by the material around it."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Now you offer me a scientific explanation for what you previously called magic."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Magic covers the entire cosmic system of functions," he replied. "Science covers only the small patch of that system we can rationalize." He told me how the strange composition of Glumpalt had affected the life developing upon it. The customary subdivisions of animal life never occurred. AM genes made it possible for a fish-man to produce bird-man progeny. Uncertainties of day and climate did nothing to regularize matters.</p>

  <p class="block_17">This mention of bird-men was the first I had heard of them. A derv later I saw one with my own eyes. It had begun to snow with a tranquil determination that took the heart out of me. I looked hopelessly up at the thick sky.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Poised a few feet above me was a skinny thing with flapping wings. I saw the wings were of skin, mottled now with goose-flesh and with dangling raw pink fingers at their outer edges. The eyes of this creature, Hie holes scooped in mud, were fixed upon me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I flung a stone at it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The flying creature, rattling its obscene pinions, swerved higher through the snow.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Interpreter tilted up his rump and shot from it a line of that sticky strand I knew so well. It sailed^up and curled about the flying thing's ankle. Of all that I saw on Glumpalt, this incident stands out most vividly in my mind. The bird-man lost his equilibrium, toppling backward with hoarse cries.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The poor creature made a bad landing and sat a few yards from us in the snow, shivering. When we approached, he clucked for mercy in a bizarre tongue.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He was naked except for a helmet strapped to his skull.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Untidy fur covered his body from the waist down. He was pigeon-chested. His face resembled a mole's, with bristles sticking from his snout. His skin, including those disgusting wings that hung from his shoulders like two empty sacs, was blue or yellow. He looked near to death with cold and fright.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Interpreter questioned him ferociously in the clucking tongue. He knocked the pathetic creature over into the snow before swiveling an eyeball at me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This is bad, friend biped," he said. "The Ungulph of Quilch is now engaged in another season of looting. If he finds me, my gravestone is made. His men are hereabouts— this creature is one of them. We must take to the nearest village and hide."</p>

  <p class="block_17">From what I had heard of the Ungulph from Thrash Pondo-Pons, I knew he would be unpleasant. I pressed on with the Interpreter, the bird-man dragging along behind us, tethered by his ankle and uttering chirps of woe.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The village we arrived at was the most disgusting I had come upon. Its inhabitants took their dominant characteristic from the rabbit; they had long ears and lived underground. We underwent the usual purification rites; fortunately I still had with me the silver casket containing the purification powder that had belonged to Thrash. When we had performed the ritual in the snow, we were allowed to go with stooped shoulders down a passage into the earth.</p>

  <p class="block_17">On either side of our way ran tunnels, some only cul-de-sacs that were filled with squalling families.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This place stinks!" I gasped. Underfoot was like a refuse heap.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It is warm," replied the Interpreter. I wondered if a sense of smell existed on this forsaken planet.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The tunnel we were in seemed to be a main road. It ended in a broad cavern through which ran a river. Along the waterfront were hovels hanging onto the very edge of the water. To one of these we were led by a rabbit-man the Interpreter accosted.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We were shown a foul-smelling cupboard they called a room. Here the rabbit-man left us, taking the bird-man with him. The latter chirped in protest as he was dragged away.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What will happen to the bird-man?" I inquired when we were alone.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I have sold him for our night's board," said the Interpreter. "Proceed with my Rolfial lesson. We were on the subject of religions, but you will have to explain to me again what the Assumption was."</p>

  <p class="block_17">So I talked. I pictured my Rolfial words being imprisoned by that incredible brain within which two thousand other languages already lay captive. I saw them lined up like bottles gathering dust in an attic.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When we were called to feed, we descended to a room full of long-eared and variegated creatures, who paid less attention to us than the meal. The meal tasted better than anything I had eaten on Glumpalt. It was a yellowy stew, bony and greasy perhaps, but with a savor.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Excellent!" I said at last to my companion. "I am grateful to you for so excellent a feed."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Direct your gratitude to the bird-man. He has provided."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How's that?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Only the wings are not edible. And they can be tanned and will make someone an excellent cloak."</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_15">V</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">To overcome my nausea, I forced the Interpreter to take me outside. We walked up and down. Several local inhabitants were listening to a fellow with long ears and whiskers who stood on a stool to address them. His gestures were violent and excited. I asked the Interpreter what was happening.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The talkative fellow is a politician. He says that if everyone supports him, he will banish short ears from the warren forever."</p>

  <p class="block_17">My companion, yawning furiously, dragged me back to our cupboard. Everyone else was going home. Lights were winking out, doors were closing. The underground town was preparing for hibernation.</p>

  <p class="block_17">For some while I slept. Waking with a headache, I lay motionless. A red light filtered through our window. A noise like a pistol shot roused me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Interpreter lay close by me. The great shell covering most of his body had split clean across. This was the noise I had heard. As I looked, peering through the red glow, I saw his shell gape wider. Frightened now, I called to him; he did not move.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The two edges of shell were wide apart and still slowly opening. I became belatedly aware of a chorus of shrieks outside. For the first time it occurred to me to wonder what the red glow was.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Thrusting my head out of the window, I saw an alarming spectacle. Sailing down the river were a number of fire rafts loaded high with burning wood. Some of them drifted to the edge of the river, where they set fire to the closely-packed houses. The screaming increased as the people ran from the flames.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Again I turned to the Interpreter; we were in danger. Shaking did not rouse him. His carapace fell off with a clatter, beneath it I saw a new soft shell and realized he was shedding the old one, remaining in a trance during the process. Seizing the sticky rope that secured me, I cut it easily on the sharp edge of the old carapace. But why should I run way, when this poor bag of crab flesh was taking me to Ongustura and the TransBurst Traders' rocket as swiftly possible? Alone I should be at a loss. Smoke billowed in through the window.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Glancing Out, I saw a fire raft jammed against the river-ink only a few yards away, setting light to the next house, took hold of my companion by two legs, slung him over my shoulder, and hurried from the house.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A mob seethed around the waterfront, dashing that way id this in their alarm. Through the din of their voices one t-repeated word came to me: "Ungulph!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Now the Ungulph's soldiers appeared. They had chosen is village for one of their raids. After the fire rafts, rafts with warriors drifted down the underground river, he rabbit people fled, shrieking. I followed. </p>

  <p class="block_17">The tunnels were full of people, all rushing to escape. One could only press forward and hope to be ejected into the night. I had the Interpreter on my back and panic in my ;art. At last the darkness seemed to thin. The crowds fell away ahead. The next moment I was out into the open. </p>

  <p class="block_17">At once, a crushing blow caught me over the shoulders. fell to my knees, looking up under the carapace I bore, I was silhouetted against the night sky two giant soldiers of Ungulph. Posted at the entrance to the warren-village, they each bore a mighty ax with which they cleft in two all ho emerged into the open. I had escaped death only because the Interpreter lay over me and took the blow. I found I was almost cut in half; his new shell had done nothing to protect him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I was grabbed and flung to one side, onto a pile of bodies ling searched for valuables. Beyond the pile, sitting in an )en tent, was a swinish fellow in robes. He sat gazing at the blankets laid before him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I had no doubt this was the Ungulph of Quilch. His four tusks were capped with gold, and from them hung four tie bells that tinkled when he turned his great head. Bristles covered his face. His lower jaw was an immense scoop; he had a yard of underlip. Long, dark robes covered his shaggy body.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Behind him, in the tent, stood a slighter figure. It was burn! It was, indeed, a beautiful girl with dark, short-cropped hair. If this was the Ungulph's daughter, I had heard her from Thrash.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I lay where I was, shocked by the Interpreter's death as much as anything. When my wits returned, dawn was breaking. The sky along one stretch of the horizon grew suddenly pale; a blazing white sun appeared.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Jumping up, I plunged down the mound of bodies. I ran past the Ungulph's tent and toward open country. The Ungulph's men instantly gave chase. Several bird-men took off and flew after me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I would have escaped but for the abyss!</p>

  <p class="block_17">I pulled up on its very edge. There I stood shuddering, foi I had almost plunged in. Before me lay a great gorge thousands of feet deep, its sides so sheer as to be unclimbable. ]j turned, but my pursuers were upon me, and I was hauled struggling before the Ungulph, who came striding up to inspect me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Knowing it to be useless to ask such a swine for mercy, I took the opposite tack.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"So, Ungulph, you come before me to ask for mercy!" cried in Galingua, though my voice shook. "I planned to lead your men into this great abyss of mine, but repented a the last moment. Let me go free or I will cause my abyss t( open still further and swallow you all."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Ungulph's savage face regarded me. Then he turned around and bellowed so that his four bells shook. His daughter timidly answered him. He barked at her; she replied and turned to me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"My father, the Ungulph, does not speak Galingua; he asks you to speak in the local court tongue."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am the great magician Bywithanfrom," I declared, “I speak in what language I prefer. Who else speaks Galingu; here?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Only I, sir."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What is your name, fair one?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am dark, sir, and my name is Chebarbar."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Tell your father my abyss will devour him unless he let me go."</p>

  <p class="block_17">When this was translated, the Ungulph gave a bellow a rage. His four hooves pawed the ground. Then he rushed for ward and seized me by the waist. For a second I hung upsid down—then he flung me forward into the abyss.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A dying man sees and knows many things. Among all th terrible details that stood out in my mind, one in particular was clear: as I plunged down, some stones fell too.</p>

  <p class="block_17">My descent slowed. I began to float up again. The AM material and the ballast had lain forgotten in my pockets; and I fell, some of the ballast dropped free, saving my life. Buoye by the AM material, I rose again, righting myself as I went.</p>

  <p class="block_17">My head appeared over the lip of the drop. A groan cam from the ragged crowd. As one man, they fell to the ground, the Ungulph and Chebarbar with them, and groveled with superstitious awe. This gave me a chance to scramble to safety and weight my pockets with fresh stones. Then I went to Chebarbar, helped her to her feet, and motioned to her father to stand.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Tell your father the Ungulph," I said, "that despite his wickedness I bear him no malice, for he can do me no harm If he will provide me with a steed, I will leave him in peace."</p>

  <p class="block_17">She repeated this in her own tongue. I was nervous and uneasy. Still, I had to get away and find a guide and interpreter to lead me to Ongustura. While I worried, the Ungulph grunted.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"My father the Ungulph says he regrets trying to harm so great a magician. He will furnish you with a steed. He will do anything you desire for the benefit of your great magic. He needs protection from his enemies."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He is a wise man," I said. I thought rapidly. Chebarbar was hardly as pretty as I had believed at first. She had a snub nose, freckles, and uneven teeth—but I was fortunate that ml she had a normal face at all. She seemed intelligent and not too disagreeable; her figure was good. I spoke again, producing from my pack the silver powder casket I had taken from Thrash.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Tell your father the Ungulph that this casket is powerful magic. The thing it contains is what the most contented man on Glumpalt needs. It is something mightier than the whole universe. It is what will save the Ungulph even if ,he is faced with inevitable death. Tell him that he may have this casket and all it contains if I may have you, Chebarbar, in exchange."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Her voice faltered as she translated this.</p>

  <p class="block_17">By now we had about us a jostling multitude of half-men, in all the varied shapes and sizes that made up the Ungulph's legions. I hated them for the cruel way they had destroyed the warren-village. They made me more determined than ever to get to Ongustura quickly.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Chebarbar turned back and addressed me. She was very pale.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"My father the Ungulph says that since I am a woman I am of little value to him. He will happily exchange me for the magic casket, if it holds what you say."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It contains just what I say. Tell him to open it only in emergency,"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Already a steed was being brought forward. It was striped like a tiger, Haough it had the horn of a rhinoceros and six legs. A ladder was set at its flank. I mounted, pulling up Chebarbar and setting her before me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When I whacked the creature's behind with a sort of paddle affixed to the saddle for that purpose, it burst immediately into a gallop—much to my relief. The soldiery fell back to let it through. Bearing away from the abyss, we headed for a track leading toward wooded country. I kept glancing back to see if we were pursued.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Why do you look back so often?" Chebarbar protested. "My father the Ungulph will not follow unless you tricked him."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I am afraid he may open the casket. It is empty, Chebarbar."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Then what does it contain that the most contented man on Glumpall needs?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"A contented man needs nothing."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What is in it mightier than the universe?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Nothing is mightier than the universe."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What is in it that will save my father from inevitable death?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Nothing can save a man from inevitable death. And that is what the casket contains—nothing!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">I saw that her shoulders were heaving. I regretted having played a trick on her father; then I realized that she was not crying, but laughing. It was the first pleasing laughter I had heard since materializing in Smith's Burst.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_15">VI</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">When we had put some distance between us and the Ungulph, I let the tiger-rhino rest. We stopped by a brook amid a clump of trees and climbed down.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I must have a drink," I said, dropping to the ground beside the brook. One of the trees lifted its root from the brook and squirted me with a jet of water. Chebarbar laughed. She explained that these trees were semisentient, capable of moving at will along a moisture supply. They had used a typical way of defending that supply.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I moved to a free -section of the brook; there we drank and held a council of war. We had no food; my time was running out, making it imperative to reach Ongustura without further delay. Chebarbar told me she thought we could be no more than three days from that city, but confessed that she did not know the way. Her father had an old rivalry with the place, never visiting it except to attack its outskirts.</p>

  <p class="block_17">This news, just when success was almost within my reach, flung me into great depression. I buried my face in my hands and groaned. To my surprise, Chebarbar put an arm around my shoulders.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don"t be unhappy," she said. "I cannot bear to see a brave man despair. I think I have something that may comfort you."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Releasing me, she began to untie the cord that confined her breast to her tunic.</p>

  <p class="block_17">'This is most womanly—" I began, but she was fishing out a small, dagger-shaped talisman that hung by a chain around her neck. She dangled the bauble before me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"With this we can summon Squexie Oxin. It will surely help us when it sees this talisman."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I asked the obvious question, and she told me that her father the Ungulph had long ago saved the Squexie Oxin from death. Recognizing it as a useful ally, he had given it a castle in his lands; there it lived in isolation, although it would come forth to aid the Ungulph when summoned by talisman.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Squexie Castle is only a short way from here," Chebarbar explained. "I will take you there, and then the Squexie will take us to Ongustura, protecting us all the way."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I jumped up, ready to be moving. The Ungulph's daughter added, "There are two hindrances to the plan. In the first place, the Squexie must not discover who I am, or it would deliver me forcibly back to my father. But it is hardly likely to find out, since it has never seen me."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And the other snag?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The Squexie only becomes available when the Black Sun rises. Fortunately, by the look of the sky, that will not be long now."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I squinted upward. The dazzling white sun had already passed its zenith, though I judged it to be some hours from setting. The yellow and the pink-custard suns had risen again without my knowing. Between them, the three suns had driven every cloud from the sky; it was uncomfortably hot. The nearby tree-things ambled along by the brook, squirting water over themselves.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Recalling what Thrash Pondo-Pons had said about the TransBurst ship lifting off the day after the Black Sun set, I asked Chebarbar, "How long will the Black Sun remain above the horizon? We have to be in Ongustura when it sets, or very shortly after."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It depends," she said. "The Black Sun"s orbits are so irregular that my father's astronomers cannot compute them, for they are controlled by a magician in a far country."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Tell your father's astronomers to buy themselves a telescope," I growled, climbing up into the saddle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Chebarbar snuggled up in front of me and we were off, the girl pointing out the way. The landscape became almost pretty. We passed through great plantations of holly, with berries the size and color of oranges. Indeed, they tasted quite like oranges, except for an unpleasant tang about them that Chebarbar said was neon, an inert gas tapped from the air by the plants' sharp leaves.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As we ate, we heard people approaching. Entering painfully into the holly thicket, we persuaded our steed to lie down, and lay beside him ourselves. Some of the Ungulph's men appeared; Chebarbar learned from what they were saying that they searched for her; she clung tightly to me.</p>

  <p class="block_17">At last we picked ourselves up and went on.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Beyond the plantation the ground rose. Mounting the incline, we found at the top the lip of a shallow crater perhaps half a mile in diameter.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I gazed at it in awe, for it was an impressive, though dreary, sight. An island stood in the middle of the crater, and on this island stood a castle built, as it seemed, of a random pile of flaking slate. It had no regular shape, no windows, no towers. Its plane surfaces were as dull as death.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The castle of the Squexie Oxin," Chebarbar said, clinging to my arm.</p>

  <p class="block_17">There was no way of getting to the ghastly castle. The island on which it stood was surrounded with a sort of oily water that filled the crater to its lip. There was no bridge.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Everything about us was absolutely still, the holly plantation behind, the great bright landscape ahead. It might all have been a weird, meaningless painting, quite without life, but for the waters of the crater. They bubbled and moved like a mindless creature heaving in its sleep. In one place in particular, in a line stretching from rim to island, the liquid milled and tumbled.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Diving in and out of this stuff, flying, then diving again, were strange birds like plucked pelicans. From the eminence on which we stood we heard their desolate cries.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We stood there in a kind of trance—and so were easily surrounded by the Ungulph's men, who burst from the holly bushes. Ten of them, miscellaneous-shaped brutes, stood there, waving tentacles, claws, or swords at us. This time I knew I would need more than cunning to save us from death.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I was seized before I could move. My hands were pulled behind my back by a sort of ox-headed insect who stank of fish. Chebarbar was also seized, and a rough paw clapped across her mouth to stop her screams.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Yet the screams went on. The creature who held me drew a great sword and pointed it at my chest. Then he, too, as the others were doing, paused to see who screamed. It was one of the Ungulph's men. His shaking claw went to the horizon beyond the Squexie's castle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Into the bright sky there was growing a great fan of blackness. At its edges it was a pallid gray, in the center it was as dark as midnight. Though the three suns still burned in the sky, they had no effect on that segment of night.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The impression this produced on the Ungulph"s men was immediate. They let go of us and turned to run for shelter in the plantation. Chebarbar and I were miraculously free again.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The Black Sun's rising!" Chebarbar cried, and she too would have run away in panic had I not grasped her tightly.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Now we can call on the Squexie," I said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In their haste to get away the soldiers had dropped a sword, a bundle of disgusting food, a primitive lantern, and a cloak of skins. Picking up the cloak, I put it around Chebarbar, who shivered though it was still hot. I thrust the sword through my belt, hung the lantern over my shoulder, and kicked the food away.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The birds in the crater had fallen silent. All was quiet everywhere. That great black fan was spilling over the horizon into the sky.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Over the crater's oily contents a thick mist was forming. Color whirled in it, so that I was reminded of the rainbow curtain that stood before the Interpreter's house; this made me think that if there were AM material in the crater, it would probably cause that curious disturbance of the waters. Proof of this theory seemed to be that the mist was especially dense over the most turbulent strip. As the sky grew darker, the mist became thicker and brighter.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Now more than half the sky had turned ashy gray or else completely black. The three suns still shone, but their power had left them. They were as useless as balloons against the encroaching dark.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Then the Black Sun rose over the horizon!</p>

  <p class="block_17">Just for a moment I saw it clearly by the light of the other suns. It was a great sooty ball, crammed with darkness, radiating blackness. A chilly wind swept the land. Though the other three suns still burned in the sky, they were fast disappearing. Everything turned to night.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Never tell me you have seen a fearful sight until you have stood on Glumpalt and watched the Black Sun rise!</p>

  <p class="block_17">It absorbs all light like blotting paper, and an intense cold prevails. The explanation of this unique phenomenon soon occurred to me. Bearing in mind the mixed origins of Smith's Burst, it became obvious that this monstrous, impossible sun was a ball of antimatter of such strength that even its visible emissions were of reverse polarity.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The darkness that embraced us was complete. Shivering, I pulled the primitive lantern from my shoulder and attempted to light it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It gave forth no light. Only the fact that I burned my finger</p>

  <p class="block_17">on it assured me that it was functioning. The AM radiations of the Black Sun had blanketed it entirely. Though I held it before my eyes until my eyebrows singed, I could see nothing.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Yet a light was visible ahead of us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Seizing Chebarbar's hand and the bridle of the tiger-rhino, I ventured cautiously to the lip of that dark crater.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The thick mist that spanned the water had frozen solid. Glowing with many hues, it illumined its own way over the waters. No doubt a certain AM content explained its luminosity.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"A way to Squexie Oxin," Chebarbar murmured. "I told you it was available only when the Black Sun rose. Come, I am not afraid."</p>

  <p class="block_17">For myself, I could not say as much. At any time I would have been loath to visit that frowning castle; at this forbidding midnight, doubly so. Moreover, I hated to trust myself to that fragile bridge. As we stepped onto it, it groaned in protest.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Leaving our steed on the bank with instructions to remain, we ventured forward. Once we were onto the bridge, it was steady enough, being of the consistency of firm snow. We sank up to our ankles in it but no more.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Thus we came to the island and to the castle of the Squexie, As we reached it, a slab of it fell inward. A piping voice uttered words that Chebarbar translated to me as "welcome.” We passed in, Chebarbar swinging her talisman, and found a fire, giving forth warmth and light. The flames came from a sort of trough, beneath which a pipe ran down through the floor. I guessed that some sort of oil was being burned—an oil possibly from the crater, containing AM matter, or else it would have been powerless to pierce the Black Sun's darkness. Before this fire stood the Squexie Oxin.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We greet you!" Chebarbar said, or words to that effect</p>

  <p class="block_17">She was greeting what I first mistook for a giant Christmas tree. The castle seemed to have only one room, and this tree seemed to be the only thing in the room. Regarding it more closely, I saw that its shaggy texture resembled a cactus covered with spikes. Even as I looked, it fell apart.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It disintegrated into hundreds of identical logs, each the size of a rolled hearth rug, each covered with the spikes. Most of these logs contented themselves with milling about our feet; one stood on end and sprouted a sort of flower that assumed lips and ears. It conversed with Chebarbar.</p>

  <p class="block_17">While they talked, one of the logs inspected me, rubbing my leg with its spikes. These were fleshy and not particularly sharp. The feeling nauseated me so much that I gave the log a kick. Every log twitched in sympathy; the ones nearest me blossomed forth with mouths and squealed in protest.</p>

  <p class="block_17">So I learned that the Squexie was a sort of Gestalt entity, all its parts serving a greater whole. This did not surprise me. Nothing surprised me. I began again feverishly thinking of the comfort of a bunk on a TransBurst ship.</p>

  <p class="block_17">At last Chebarbar finished talking.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Well, does this thing help us?" I demanded.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"For the sake of the Ungulph of Quilch, the Squexie will take us to Ongustura. It seems to have very little regard for you; you would be advised not to molest it again."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Squexie informed us it was ready to go, and shortly we were being bundled out of the castle. We crossed by the frozen bridge, the logs bounding along all around us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">To my surprise and delight, we found the tiger-rhino still waiting at the crater rim. Chebarbar and I climbed onto it with cries of affection; it was like meeting an old friend again! Also, it solved a severe problem. In this unnatural blackness, the Squexie—obviously composed in part of AM material— could see as easily as we see in a normal day. It needed no light. But we did, and we had none. The way to Ongustura would have been hell had it not been for the tiger-rhino, which seemed to pick its way through the impenetrable black by divine instinct.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Almost at once, another quarrel developed—or rather the Squexie developed it. His high-pitched voice sounded from lips ranged all around us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What's it raving about now? Let's get moving!" I snapped.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The Squexie says it only offered to take two of us to Ongustura—not three. Accordingly, it will not take us at all."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"My godly galaxy! Tell him we are not three, nor two, but one. Together we make a creature called a Syllabub, a Gestalt beast with magical properties."</p>

  <p class="block_17">This rubbish was translated to the Squexie, who mercifully swallowed it. We moved on. It seemed a terrible pity to me that such a marvelous creature as the Squexie should in all its multitude of parts be unable to muster the intelligence of a monkey.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Nevertheless, on our cold and tedious journey, I did manage to extract some information from it. In particular I was interested to learn more about the behavior of antimatter. Hitherto I had thought that a violent explosion resulted when it came into contact with ordinary matter. Although the Squexie knew little and cared less about the origins of Smith's Burst, it too accepted that this was what had happened originally. Bi^t it said there was a third force present on Glumpalt called "noggox."</p>

  <p class="block_17">“Tell it that all matter must have either a positive or negative charge," I instructed Chebarbar.</p>

  <p class="block_17">She translated its reply.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The Squexie says that between plus numbers and minus number lies a point of neutrality called 'nought' or 'zero,' This point exists also in matter, though it is rare, and it is called 'noggox.' It can act as a binding agent between anti-and ordinary matter."</p>

  <p class="block_17">I fell silent. Chunks of the AM stuff were still in my pocket. I knew I had only to get them and my knowledge back to civilization and I could become rich enough to buy Glumpalt many times over. But what would you do with a hell like Glumpalt?!</p>

  <p class="block_17">Such speculations, and two breaks for sleep, when Chebar-bar and I huddled close, were almost our only distractions on that journey. An AM moon spun across the sky, giving some welcome light, and was too quickly gone. Apart from the stray moon we had one other source of light, though it was only occasional and weak. We journeyed past several plantations of the orange-bearing hollies. The neon they contained had evidently an antimatter element that made them shine with a faint, ghostly glow.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As we rode on, I became rather tired, and called a short halt. Just a short distance away from our resting place ran a tiny stream. On its nearer bank stood one tall and ancient tree. Hoping it was not a tree-being, such as I had encountered earlier, I ran to the stream for a drink of water. Sure enough, the tree lifted a taproot from the water and squirted me. The liquid was freezing; it stopped me dead in my stride. I panicked for the moment and thought that my only escape i was to climb swiftly into its branches.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I was frozen from the wetting I had got. A cool breeze j stirred, making me shiver uncontrollably. Hoping to warm | my hands at least, I unhitched the primitive lantern from my I shoulder and lit it. Its glow was so gratifying that only after some while did I observe the light to be not only warming but illuminating me!</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_15">VII</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_17">Amazed, I stared up. Many stars, the luridly complex constellations of Smith's Burst, shone down on me. Ghostly forms of the distant Glumpaltian landscape were again visible. The Black Sun had set! The relief of being rid of that stygian gloom was great—and rudely shattered. Angry shouts below made me look down. I was discovered. Too late, I doused my wick; I had already given myself away.</p>

  <p class="block_17">My tree was besieged. Nor was that all. Squexie and the Ungulph's soldiers stood peaceably side by side, all their</p>

  <p class="block_17">belligerence directed at me. A great fire was being kindled near the plantation. By it I saw the demon king figure of the Ungulph of Quilch himself; the caps of his four tusks sparkled.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Cupping my hands, I shouted down to Chebarbar and asked her what had happened.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Alas, we are lost!" she cried. "My father the Ungulph has just arrived on the scene. He has shown the Squexie his talisman fmd told that treacherous creature who I am. He says I must be killed for what he calls my desertion. The Squexie has turned against us.''</p>

  <p class="block_17">Though my thoughts raced, I could think of nothing to say—I, who had always hoped my last words would be memorable.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Do something!" she called. "In a minute they will have you down from there, and kill us both."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't worry," I said. "Tell your father that I will come down and spin my sword in the air. If it lands with its point in the earth, he shall kill me personally; if it lands flat, his gallant soldiers shall have the honor of tearing me into little pieces."</p>

  <p class="block_17">When this was translated, a roar of excitement rose from the watchers. They obviously regarded this fancy with delight. Almost with love, the Ungulph beckoned me to descend. My offer was accepted.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Trembling with cold and tension, I climbed down the tree , and landed among the motley rabble. They moved aside for me with some show of respect. When I drew my sword, the mutter swelled in volume, and they pressed closer. I cleared myself a circle, taking care that Chebarbar, who was held firmly on her mount, should be near its circumference. I waved my sword. ,.. "Here it goes!" I cried. "Watch it!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Though they did not understand, the exhortation was unnecessary. Every eye followed that glittering blade as it rose, turning over and over; every face was upturned to follow its course. Since I had taken the precaution, before descending the tree, of tying a small chunk of AM material to the weapon, I reckoned the sword would continue to climb for ten seconds and take twice as long to come down. I could use those seconds.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As the eyes turned upward, glued to that fateful weapon, I ran for it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The wretch holding the tiger-rhino's bridle scarcely noticed as f snatched it from him. Leaping into the saddle, I applied the paddle hard. Our brave beast shot forward so rapidly that Chebarbar and I were almost thrown off. A moment later we had broken through the crowd and were away.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In another moment the whole mob was screaming after us.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_15">VIII</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">Chebarbar and I could only hang on tightly and hope that our steed would increase the lead he had over the rest of the field. We had no idea of direction. We could but hope.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We were lucky. The flat terrain soon turned into an incline up which the six-footed tiger-rhino moved easily. Small rocky hills loomed around us; the way grew so narrow that our pursuers were forced to proceed in single file, to their great confusion.</p>

  <p class="block_17">We trotted through a pass and began to descend. From then on our followers gave up the chase. They camped there, on the heights; during part of our descent we saw their fires burning above us. The Ungulph's men and the Squexie together made a formidable body of creatures; gradually more and more points of fire, diminished by distance, sprang up, until a half-circle glittered like a tiara over our heads.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Although we were safe from pursuit, trouble, my constant companion on Glumpalt, had not forsaken us. Dawn was on its way, and ahead of us through the paling light I discerned a considerable town filling the valley. Chebarbar and I—and the tiger-rhino, for that matter—needed nourishment and rest. Since we had no magical powder with which to perform the usual absolution ceremony, we had to get into the town unobserved.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The town—like every other town on Glumpalt—^was a rubbish dump. The only difference here was that the rubbish-houses were separated into islands of rubbish by the untypically wide dust tracks. In the tired light of dawn, we had no trouble entering and finding safety.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Chebarbar sold her talisman to a foul old woman at an old stall. With the proceeds we hired ourselves an unsanitary cupboard of a room and bought ourselves food.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Eating ravenously—nothing could turn my stomach now— we stared out of our tiny windows. Hills ringed the town; on their heights we could just make out fires and the figures of men. The Ungulph and the Squexie were still there; it looked as if they had the place surrounded and were intending to attack it as they had attacked the warren-village.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Above the hills rose the yellow sun, striking brightly onto the muddle about us. Any hope I might have drawn from it was dashed by my knowledge that this was the day the Trans-Burst Traders' ship would be leaving for Acrostic and other civilized ports. How long before the next one would call, or how far away Ongastura was, I knew not.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't be so gloomy!" Chebarbar cried, taking my hand. "Here we are both safe and together."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Absently, I stroked her hair. I had never told her I came from a distant planet and intended to return there unaccompanied as soon as possible.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We are the same shape and color," she said. "Why don't you kiss me?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">The floor moved, the whole building shook. For a moment, I thought these were illusions produced by emotional strain. Then we ran to the window, in time to see a nearby collection of houses collapse into a column of dust. Over the distant heights a puff of smoke hung.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"My father is bombarding the city!" Chebarbar cried.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"With artillery?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Yes, indeed. He has half a dozen good cannons imported from a distant world."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I never knew there would be any such weapons on Glum-palt. Why didn't you tell me before?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">She looked furious. Her mouth tightened at each comer. "I didn't tell you because you never asked me! You ask me nothing about anything but immediate necessities. Though I have followed you and helped you, you have taken absolutely no interest in me. How do you think I feel, eh?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">By a happy turn of fate I was spared having to reply, for the building collapsed beneath our feet. Though we had suffered nothing like a direct hit, the house was so haphazardly constructed that the distant shock tumbled it. Chebarbar and I were on the first floor; three upper stories descended upon us.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It was alarming, but little more dangerous than being bombarded by a pack of cards. The worst part was being half-stifled by dust.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dizzily, I sat up, stood up, and then pulled Chebarbar up after me. We climbed from the debris. Another building on our left fell slowly as we passed. Glancing back, I spotted the enemy close behind. In my bones I felt the end was near.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Pounding through the dust, we rounded another corner.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Bright, light, trebly blessed, the sweet slender snout of an interplanetary freighter pierced the sky ahead. My heart leaped in joy and astonishment.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Come on!" I cried.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The ship stood behind a wall eight feet high. Double gates bearing the legend TRANSBURST TRADERS were firmly closed. Over them glared a red notice: BLAST OFF IMMINENT.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The Glumpaltian horde swept around the comer behind us. Wildly emptying all my pockets of stones, I found I had only two sizable chunks of AM matter left. Tucking them imder my armpits, I seized Chebarbar again and with an enormous jump cleared the wall.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Officials—wonderful, symmetrical officials—came up at once. I explained who I was; I gave them my Galactic Credit Card, which stood high enough to make them welcome me as an unexpected passenger.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Well, you'd better get aboard, sir," the bursar said. "Everything's ready for countdown. We've had clearance."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I thought your Glumpaltian-routed freighter only called at Ongustura," I remarked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He stared at me curiously. "This is Ongustura," he said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">I was flabbergasted. "But the islands ... the lake...."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh, didn't you recognize the place with the tide out? For about a fortnight after the rising of the Black Sun, Ongustura is left high and dry, as you see it at present. Now you'd better get aboard with your lady."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Chebarbar was sobbing. She clung to my dusty shirt, talking almost incoherently.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I cannot come with you, my dearest. The magic of this ship is too powerful for me. If I entered it, I should die! You know I love you—yet I cannot, cannot come!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">There was nothing I could say. This was as well, since I had been about to explain tactfully that I was unable to take her. Mutely, I pressed one of the two chunks of AM into her palm; it would help the quick-witted girl to buy her way out of future trouble.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Weep not, Chebarbar," I said, kissing her nose. "Time heals all things."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Smarting under the cliche, I climbed the freighter's ramp. The smell of canned air ahead was like perfume. Just before entering the air lock I turned to look back at the weeping Chebarbar.</p>

  <p class="block_30"><span class="text_8">Without surprise I noticed that her tears were falling upward toward the tatterdemalion clouds.</span><span class="text_9"><br class="calibre1" id="calibre_pb_9"/>
