 <br>

  <p class="block_21">In a great concourse of worlds such as ours, the extinction of species occurs frequently — as frequently as space going man opens up another planet. Sometimes it is an inferior human race, such as the inhabitants of Istinogurzibeshilaha, that is threatened. More often it is a species that has some kind of social organization but that lacks higher intelligence.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Colonization forms one of the main pressures operating against the survival of alien life. Every standard year, three new planets are opened up. Where possible, the colonists are assisted to fit into the network of life already established there. Sometimes the nature of this life is such that this can-not be done, in which case more drastic measures have to be taken.</p>

  <p class="block_22">Over the past four millennia, much good work has been carried out by the Planetary Ecological Survey, a Starswarm-wide organization with headquarters on the populous pleasure world of Droxy, in Sector Diamond. PES sends out teams that land on planets ripe for development and assess how the local life can best be preserved — or eliminated.</p>

  <p class="block_22">It is never an easy job. Sometimes man himself may provide a complicating factor.</p>

    <br/>
  <br>
<br/>
  <br>

  <p class="block_16">At other times of day, the pygmies brought the old man fish from the river, or the watercress he loved, but in the afternoon they brought him two bowls of entrails.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He stood to receive them, staring over their heads through the open door, looking at the blue jungle without seeing it. He dared not let his subjects see that he suffered or was weak—the pygmies had a short way with weakness. Before they entered his room, he forced himself to stand erect, using his stick for support.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The two bearers bowed their heads until their snouts were almost in the still steaming bowls.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Your god gives you thanks. Your offering is received," the old man said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Whether or not they really understood his clicking attempt to reproduce their tongue, he could not tell. They rose and departed with their rapid, slithering walk. In the bowls, the oily substance glistened, reflected from the sunshine outside.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Sinking back on to his bed, the old man fell into his usual fantasy: the pygmies came to him, and he treated them not with forbearance but with hatred. He poured over them the weight of his long-repressed loathing, striking them with his stick and driving them and all their race forever from this planet. They were gone. The azure sun and the blue jungles were his alone; he could live where nobody would ever find or worry him. He could die at last, as simply as a leaf falls from a tree.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The reverie faded, and he recognized it for what it was. He knotted his hands together and coughed a little blood. The bowls of intestines would have to be disposed of.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Next day, the rocket ship landed a mile away.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">The overlander lumbered along the forest track. It made good speed with Barney Brangwyn at the wheel. On either side of the vehicle, the vegetation was of the somber blue-green type that characterized most living things on the planet Kakakakaxo.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Neither of you looks in the pink of health!" Barney observed, flicking his eyes from the track to glance at the faces of his two companions.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The three members of the Planetary Ecological Survey team had blue shadows shading every feature of their countenances. The shadows gave an illusion of chill, yet in this equatorial zone, and with the sun Cassivelaunus shining at zenith, it was comfortably warm, if not hot. The surrounding jungle grew thickly; the bushes sagged under the weight of their own foliage. They were heading for a man who had lived in these surroundings for almost twenty years. Now that they were here, it became easier to see why he was universally regarded as a hero.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There's plenty of cover here for any green pygmies who may be watching us," Tim Anderson said, peering at the thickets.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney chuckled at the worried note in the younger man's voice.</p>

  <p class="block_17">'The pygmies are probably still getting over the racket we made in landing," he said; "we'll be seeing them soon enough. When you get as ancient as I am, Tim, you'll become less keen to meet the local bigwigs. The top dogs of any planet are generally the most obstreperous—ipso facto, as the lawyers say."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He lapsed into silence as he negotiated a gulley, swinging the big vehicle expertly up the far slope.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"By the evidence, the most obstreperous factor on Kaka-kakaxo is the climate," Tim said. "Only six or seven hundred miles north and south of here, the glaciers begin, and go right on up to the poles. I'm glad our job is just to inspect the planet—I shouldn't want to live here myself, pygmies or no pygmies. I've seen enough already to tell you that."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's not a question of choice for the colonists," Craig Hodges, leader of the team, remarked. "They come because of some kind of pressure: economic factors, oppression, destitution, or the need for lebensraum —the sort of grim necessities that keep us all on the hop."</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">"You're a cheerful couple!" Barney exclaimed. "At least Daddy Dangerfield likes it here! He has faced Kakakakaxo for nineteen years, playing god, wet-nursing his pygmies!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He crashed here accidentally; he's had to adjust,'" Craig said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What a magnificent adjustment!" Tim exclaimed. "Daddy Dangerfield, God of the Great Beyond! He was one of my childhood heroes. I can hardly believe we're going to meet him."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Most of the legends built around him originate on Droxy," Craig said, "where half the ballyhoo in the universe comes from. I am chary about the man myself, but he could prove informative."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He'll be informative,"' Barney said, skirting a thicket of rhododendron. "He'll save us a load of field work. In nineteen years—if he's anything like the man he's cracked up to be— he should have accumulated a mass of material of inestimable value to us, and to Dansson."</p>

  <p class="block_17">When a PES team landed on an unexplored planet like Kakakakaxo, they categorized possible dangers and determined the nature of the opposition the superior species would offer colonists. The superior species might be mammal, reptile, insect, vegetable, mineral, or virus. Frequently it proved so difficult that it had to be exterminated—and exterminated so that the ecological balance of the planet was disturbed as little as possible.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Their journey ended unexpectedly. They were only a mile from their ship when the jungle gave way to a cliff, which formed the base of a steep mountain. Rounding a high spur of rock, they saw a sort of settlement ahead. Barney braked and cut out the power, and the three of them sat for a minute in silence, taking in the scene.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Rapid movement under the trees followed their arrival.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Here comes the welcoming committee," Craig said. 'We'd better climb down and look agreeable, as far as that is possible. Heaven knows what they are going to make of your beard, Barney."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They were surrounded as soon as they jumped to the, ground. The pygmies moved quickly; though they appeared' from all quarters, it took them only a few seconds.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They were ugly creatures. They moved like lizards, and their skin was like lizard skin, green and mottled, except where it broke into coarse scales down their backs. None of i them stood more than four feet high. They were four-legged and two-armed. Their heads, perched above their bodies on no visible neck, were like cayman heads, fitted with long, cruel jaws and serrated teeth. These heads now swiveled from side to side, silently observing the visitors.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Once they had surrounded the ecologists, the pygmies made no further move. The initiative had passed from them. In their baggy throats, heavy pulses beat.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig pointed at a pygmy in front of him and said, "Greetings! Where is Daddy Dangerfield? We intend you no harm. We merely wish to see Dangerfield. Please take us to him."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He repeated his words in Galingua.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The pygmies stirred, opening their jaws and croaking. An excited clack-clack-clackering broke out on all sides. An overpowering odor of fish rose from the creatures. None of them volunteered anything that might be construed as a reply.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Their stocky bodies might have been ludicrous, but their two pairs of sturdy legs and their armored jaws certainly gave no cause for laughter.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"These are only animals!" Tim exclaimed. "They possess none of the personal pride you'd expect in a primitive savage. They wear no clothes. Why, they aren't even armed!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't say that until you've had a good look at their claws and teeth," Barney said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Move forward slowly with me," Craig said to his comrades. "Dangerfield must be about somewhere, heaven help him."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Thigh-deep in clacking cayman-heads, the PES men advanced toward the settlement. This maneuver was resented by the pygmies, whose noise redoubled, though they backed away without offering opposition.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Bounded on one side by the cliff face, the village stood under trees. In the branches of the trees, a colony of gay-colored birds had plaited a continuous roof out of lianas, climbers, leaves, and twigs. Under this cover, the pygmies had their rude huts, which were no more than squares of woven reed, propped at an angle by sticks to allow an entrance.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tied outside these dwellings were furry animals, walking in the small circles allowed by their leashes, and calling to each other. Their mewing cries, the staccato calls of the birds, the croaking of the cayman-heads, made a babel of sound. And over everything drifted the stench of decaying fish.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Plenty of local color," Barney remarked. "These tethered animals are an odd touch, aren't they?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">In contrast to this squalid scene was the cliff face, which had been carved with stylized representations of foliage mingled with intricate geometrical forms. The decoration rose to a height of some forty feet and was inventive and well-proportioned. Later, the ecologists were to find this work crude in detail, but from a distance its superiority to the village was marked. As they came nearer, they saw that the decorated area was the facade of a building hewn in the sheer rock, complete with doors and windows, from which pygmies watched their progress with unblinking curiosity.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I begin to be impressed," Tim observed, eyeing the patterns in the rock. "If these little horrors can create something as elaborate as that, there is hope for them yet."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Dangerfield!" Craig called, when another attempt to communicate with the pygmies failed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney pointed to the far side of the clearing. Leaning against the dun-colored rock of the cliff was a sizable hut, built of the same flimsy material as the pygmy dwellings, but constructed with more care and of less crude design.</p>

  <p class="block_17">While the ecologists were looking at it, an emaciated figure appeared in the doorway. It was human. It made its way toward them, aiding itself with a stout stick.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's Dangerfield!" Barney exclaimed. "It must be Dangerfield. As far as we know, there's no other human being on this whole planet."</p>

  <p class="block_17">A warming stream of excitement ran through Tim. Daddy Dangerfield was a legend among the youth of Starswarm. Crash-landing on Kakakakaxo nineteen years before, he had been the first man to visit this uninviting little world.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Although only eighty-six light years from Droxy, one of the great interstellar centers of commerce and pleasure, Kakakakaxo was off the trade lanes. So Dangerfield had lived alone with the pygmies for ten standard years before someone had arrived with an offer of rescue.</p>

  <p class="block_17">By then it was too late: the poison of loneliness had become its own antidote. Dangerfield refused to leave. He claimed that the pygnnies had need of him. So he remained where he was, King of the Crocodile People, Daddy to the Little Folk—as the Droxy tabloids phrased it, with their affection for capital letters and absurd titles.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As Dangerfield approached the team, the pygmies fell back before him. It was hard to recognize, in the bent figure peering anxiously at them, the young, bronzed giant by which-Dangerfield was represented in the comic strips. The thin, sardonic face with its powerful hook nose had become a caricature of itself. This was Dangerfield, but appearances suggested that the legend would outlive the man.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You're from Droxy?" he asked, speaking in Galingua. "You've come to make another film about me? I'm pleased to see you here. Welcome to the untamed planet of Kakakakaxo."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig Hodges put out his hand. "We're from Droxy," he said. "But we are no unit come to make a film; our mission is more practical than that."</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">"You ought to shoot one—you'd make your fortune. What are you doing here, then?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">As Craig introduced himself and his team, Dangerfield's manner became noticeably less cordial. He muttered angrily to himself about invaders of his privacy.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Come to our overlander and have a drink with us," Barney said. "You must be glad to have someone to talk to."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This is my place," the old man cried, waving his stick over the tawdry clearing. "I don't know what you people are doing here. I'm the man who beat Kakakakaxo. If you had pushed your way in here twenty years ago as you did just now, the pygmies would have torn you to bits—right to little bits. I tamed 'em! No living man has ever done what I've done. They've made films about my life on Droxy—that's how important I am. I'm known throughout Diamond Sector. Didn't you know that?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">His sunken eye rested on Tim Anderson. "Didn't you know that, young man?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I was brought up on those films, sir. They were made by the old Mehnoth Studios."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Yes, yes, that was the name. You don't belong to them? Why don't they come back here anymore, eh, why don't they?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tim wanted to tell this gaunt relic that Dangerfield, the Far-flung Father, had been one of his boyhood heroes, a giant through whom he had first felt the ineluctable lure of space travel; he wanted to tell him that it hurt to have the legend defaced. Here was the giant himself—bragging of his part, and bragging, moreover, in a supplicatory whine.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They came up to the overlander. Dangerfield stared at the neat shield on the side, under which the words Planetary Ecological Survey were inscribed. After a moment, he turned on Craig.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Who are you people? What do you want here? I've got troubles enough."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We're a fact-finding team, Mr. Dangerfield," Craig said. "Our business is to gather data on this planet. Next to nothing is known about ecological conditions here; the planet has never even been properly surveyed. We are naturally keen to secure your help; you should be a treasury of information</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I can't answer any questions! I never answer questions. You'll have to find out anything you want to know for yourselves. I'm a sick man—I'm in pain. I need a doctor, drugs. ... Are you a doctor?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I can administer an analgesic," Craig said. "And if you will let me examine you, I will try to find out what you are suffering from."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dangerfield waved a hand angrily in the air.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I don't need telling what's wrong with me," he snapped. "1 know every disease that's going on this cursed planet. I've got fiffins, that's my trouble, and all I'm asking you for is something to relieve the pain. If you haven't come to be helpful, you'd best get out altogether!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Just what is or are fiffns?" Barney asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They're not infectious, if that's what's worrying you. If you have only come to ask questions, clear out. The pygmies will look after me, just as I've always looked after them."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As he turned to go, Dangerfield staggered and would have fallen, had not Tim caught his arm. The old fellow shook off the support and hurried back across the clearing in a shuffle that sent the captive animals squeaking to the far end of their tethers.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Catching him up, Tim laid a hand on his arm.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Please be reasonable," he said pleadingly. "You look as if you need medical treatment, which we can give you."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I never had help, and I don't need it now. And what's more, I've made it a rule never to be reasonable."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Full of conflicting emotion, Tim turned back. He caught sight of Craig's impassive face.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We should help him," he said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He doesn't want help, from you or anyone," Craig replied, not moving. "He is his own self, with his own ways."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He may be dying," Tim said. "You've no right to be so damned indifferent." He looked defiantly at Craig, who returned his gaze, then walked rapidly away. Dangerfield, on the other side of the clearing, glanced back once and then disappeared into his hut. Barney made to follow Tim, but Craig stopped him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Leave him," he said quietly. "Let him have his temper out."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney looked straight at his friend. "Don't force the boy," he said, "He hasn't got your outlook on life."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We all have to learn, and it isn't easy to learn fast,'" Craig observed. Then, changing his tone, he said, "Dangerfield seems unbalanced, which means he may soon swing the other way and offer us help: that we should wait for; I'd be interested to get a straight record of his nineteen years here. It would make a useful psychological document, if nothing else."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He's a stubborn old guy, to my way of thinking," Barney said, shaking his head.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Which is the sign of a weak man. That's why Tim was unwise to coax him; it would merely make him more stubborn. He will come to us when he feels like it. Meanwhile, let's make the usual ground sample survey and establish the intelligence status of these cayman-heads."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Now that it was quieter, they could hear a river flowing nearby. The pygmies had dispersed; some lay motionless in their crude shelters, only their snouts showing, the blue light lying like a mist along their scales.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'd hazard they have evolved as far as they're ever going to get," Barney remarked, picking from his beard an insect which had tumbled out of the thatched trees above. "They have restricted cranial development, no opposed thumb, and no form of clothing—which means the lack of any sexual inhibition, such as one would expect to find in this Y-type culture. I should rate them as Y gamma stasis, Craig."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig nodded, smiling, as if with a secret pleasure.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Which implies you feel as I do about the cliff temple,'" he said, indicating the wealth of carving visible through the trees.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You mean—the pygmies couldn't have built it?" Barney said. Craig agreed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"These cayman-heads are far below the cultural level implicit in the architecture. They are its caretakers, not its creators. This means, of course, that there is—or was — another species, a superior species, on Kakakakaxo, which may prove more elusive than the pygmies."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig was stolid; he spoke unemphatically. But Barney, who knew something of what went on inside that head, knew that Craig's habit of throwing away an important point revealed that he was chewing something over.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Understanding enough not to probe on the subject, Barney filed it away and switched to another topic.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm just going to look at these furry pets the cayman-heads keep tied up outside their shelters," he said; "they're intriguing little creatures."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Go carefully," Craig cautioned. "Those pets may not be pets at all; the pygmies don't look like a race of animal lovers."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Well, if they aren't pets, they certainly aren't Kvestock. Judging by the smell, the cayman-heads eat nothing but fish."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Outside most of the shelters, two different animals were tethered. One was a gray, furry creature with a pushed-in face like a Pekingese dog, standing almost as hi^ as the pygmies. The other was a little creature with brown fur and a gay yellow crest; half the size of the 'peke," it resembled a miniature bear. Both pekes and bears had little black monkeylike paws, which, as the ecologists approached, were now raised as if in supplication.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They're a deal more cuddlesome than their owners," Craig said. Stooping, he extended a hand to one of the little bears. It leaped forward and clutched it, chattering.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Do you suppose the two species, the pekes and the bears, fight together?" Barney asked. "You notice they are kept tied just far enough apart so that they can't touch each other. We may have found the local variation on cockfighting."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"These beasts are about as dangerous as bunny rabbits! Even their incisors are blunt. They have no natural weapons at all."</p>

  <p class="block_17">'Talking of teeth, they exist on the same diet as their masters—^though whether from choice or necessity we'll have to discover."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney pointed to decaying piles of fish bones, fish heads, and scales on which the little animals were sitting disconsolately. Iridescent beetles scuttled among the debris.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm going to take one of these pekes back to the over-lander and examine it," he announced.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He could see a cayman snout sticking out of its shelter not three yards away; keeping it under observation, he bent over one of the pekes and tried to loosen the tightly drawn thong that kept it captive.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The cayman-head's speed was astonishing. One second, it was scarcely visible in its shelter; the next, it confronted Barney with its claws resting over his hand, its ferocious teeth bared. Small though the reptile was, it could have undoubtedly snapped his neck through.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Don't fire, or you'll have the lot on us!" Craig cried, for Barney's free hand dropped immediately for his blaster.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They were surrounded by pygmies, all scuttling up and clacking. The reptiles made their typical noises, waggling their tongues without moving their jaws. Though they crowded in, they made no attempt to attack Craig and Barney. One of them thrust himself forward and commenced to harangue them, waving his small upper arms.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Some traces of a primitive speech pattern," Craig observed coolly. "Let's try barter for your pet, Barney, while we have their attention."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dipping into one of the pouches of his duty equipment, he produced a necklace in whose marble-sized stones spirals of color danced, delicate internal springs ensuring that their hues changed continually as long as their wearer moved. It was the sort of trinket to be picked up for a few minicredits on almost any planet in Starswarm. Craig held it out to the pygmy who had delivered the speech.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The pygmy leader scrutinized it briefly, then resumed his harangue. The necklace meant nothing to him. With signs, Craig indicated that he would exchange it for one of the little bears. The leader showed no interest. Pocketing the necklace, Craig produced a mirror.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Mirrors unfailingly excite the interest of primitive tribes— yet the pygmies remained unmoved. Many of them began to disappear now the crisis was over, speeding off with their nervous, lizard movements. Putting the mirror away, Craig brought out a whistle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">It was shaped like a silver fish with an open mouth. The pygmy leader snatched it from Craig's hand, leaving the red track of its claws across his open palm. It popped the whistle into its mouth.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Here, that's not edible!" Craig said, instinctively stepping forward with his hand out. Perhaps the pygmy misinterpreted Craig's gesture and acted defensively. Snapping its jaws, it lunged at Craig's leg. As the ecologist fell, a blue shaft flashed from Barney's blaster. The noise of the thermonuclear blast rattled around the clearing, and the pygmy toppled and dropped dead, its hide smoking.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Into the ensuing silence broke the clatter of a thousand weaver birds, winging from their homes and circling high above the treetops. Barney bent down, seized Craig around the shoulders, and raised him with one arm, keeping the blaster leveled in his free hand. Over Craig's thigh, soaking through his torn trousers, grew a ragged patch of blood.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Thanks, Barney," he said. "Trade seems to be bad today. Let's get back to the overlander."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The pygmies made no attempt to attack. It was impossible to determine whether they were frightened by the show of force or had decided that the brief quarrel was no affair of theirs. At last they bent over their dead comrade, seized him by his hind feet, and dragged him off briskly in the direction of the river.</p>

  <p class="block_17">When Barney got Craig onto his bunk, he stripped his trousers off, cleansed the wound, and dressed it with a restorative culture. Although Craig had lost blood, no damage was done; his leg would be entirely healed by morning.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You got off lightly," Barney said, straightening up. "That baby could have chewed your knees off if he had been trying."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"One thing about the incident particularly interested me," Craig said. "The cayman-heads wanted the whistle because they mistook it for food; fish, as we gather from the stink outside, is a main item in their diet. The mirror and necklace meant nothing to them; I have never met a backward tribe so lacking in simple, elementary vanity. Does it connect with the absence of sexual inhibitions you mentioned?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What have they to be vain about?" Barney asked, stripping off and heading for the shower. "After five minutes out there, I feel as if the stench of fish has been painted on me with a brush."</p>

  <p class="block_17">It was not long before they realized Tim Anderson was nowhere in the overlander.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Go and see if you can find him, Barney," Craig said. "He isn't safe wandering about on his own. He'll have to learn to enjoy freedom of thought without freedom of action."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The afternoon was stretching its blue shadows across the ground. In the quiet, you could almost hear the planet turn on its cold, hard axis.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney set out toward the distant murmur of water, thinking that a river would hold as much attraction for Tim as for himself. He turned down a narrow track among the trees, then stopped, unsure which way to go. He called Tim's name.</p>

  <p class="block_17">An answer came almost at once, unexpectedly. Tim emerged from the bushes ahead and waved to Barney.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You had me worried," Barney confessed, catching up with him. "It's wiser not to stroll off without telling us."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm quite capable of looking after myself, you know," Tim said. "There's a river just beyond these bushes, wide and deep and fast-flowing. I suppose these cayman-heads are cold-blooded?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They are," Barney confirmed. "I should know. I had one of them holding hands with me a while back."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There's a bunch of them in the water now, and it's ice cold. It must flow straight down off the glaciers. The pygmies are superb swimmers, very fast, very sure; I watched them diving and coming up with fish the size of big salmon in their jaws."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney told him about the incident with the fish-whistle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm sorry about Craig's leg," Tim said, "but while we're on the subject, perhaps you can tell me why he's on my back, why he jumped down my throat when I went after Danger-field."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"He isn't in your back, and he didn't jump down your throat. At present he's worried because he smells a mystery, but is undecided where to turn for a key to it. He probably regards Dangerfield as that key; certainly he respects the knowledge the man must have, yet I think that inwardly he would prefer to tackle the whole problem alone, leaving Dangerfield out of it altogether."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Why should Craig feel like that? PES HQ instructed us to contact Dangerfield."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"True. And HQ being a tidy few light-years away is often out of touch with realities. But Craig probably thinks that old Dangerfield might be—well, misleading, ill-informed .... Craig's a man who likes to work things out for himself."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They turned and began to make their way back to the settlement, walking slowly, enjoying the mild air uncontaminated by fish.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Surely that wasn't why Craig was so ragged about helping Daddy Dangerfield?" Tim asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No, that was something else," Barney said. "PES teams are the precursors of change, remember. Before we arrive, the planets are in their natural state—unspoiled or undeveloped, whichever way you care to phrase it. After we leave, they are going to be taken over and altered, on our recommendation. However cheery you feel about man's position in the galaxy, somehow you can't help regretting that this mutilation is necessary."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's not our business to care," Tim said impatiently.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"But Craig cares, Tim. The more planets we survey, the more he feels that some mysterious—divine—balance is being ; overthrown. You can't avoid the idea that you are confronting an individual entity—and your sworn duty is to destroy it, and the enigma behind it, and turn out yet another assembly-line world for assembly-line man.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's how Craig feels about planets and people. For him, a man's character is sacrosanct; anything that has accumulated has his respect. It may be simpler to work with people who are mere ciphers, but an individual is of greater ultimate value."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's what he meant when he said Dangerfield was still his own self?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Sound skeptical if you like. It'll hit you one day. Imagine this place in fifty years, if we give it a clean bill of health. Do you think this river will run as it does now? It may be dammed to provide hydroelectric power, it may be widened and made navigable, it may be even a sewer. These birds overhead'll be extinct, or force-bred in cages, or roosting on factory roofs. Everything'll be changed—and we take much of the credit and blame for it."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I won't miss the stink of fish," Tim said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Even a stink of fish has ", Barney began, and broke off. The silence was torn right down the middle by screams. The two ecologists ran down the trail, bursting full tilt into the clearing.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A peke creature was being killed. A rabble of pygmies milled everywhere, converging on a large decayed tree stump, upon which two of their kind stood with the screaming peke held between them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">To its cries were added those of all the others tethered nearby. The cries stopped abruptly as cruel talons ripped its stomach open. Its entrails were then scooped, steaming, into a crudely shaped clay bowl, after which the ravaged body was tossed to the crowd. The pygmies scrambled for it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Before the hubbub had died down, another captive was handed up to the two executioners, kicking and crying as it went. The crowd paused to watch the fun. This time, the victim was one of the bearlike animals. Its body was gouged open, its insides turned into a second bowl. It, too, was tossed to the cayman-headed throng.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Good old Mother Nature!" Barney said angrily. "How many more of the little creatures do they intend to slaughter?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">But the killing was over. The two executioner pygmies, bearing the bowls of entrails in their paws, climbed from the tree stump and made their way through the crowd. The vessels were carried toward the rear of the village.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It looks like some sort of religious ceremony," Craig said. Barney and Tim turned to find him standing behind them. The screaming had drawn him from his bed, and he had limped over to them unobserved.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How's the leg?" Tim asked him.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It'll be better by morning, Tim."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The creature that bit you—the one Barney killed—^was thrown into the river," Tim said. "I was there watching when the others turned up and slung him in."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They're taking those bowls of guts into Dangerfield's hut," Barney said, pointing across the clearing. The two cayman-headed bearers disappeared through the hut doorway; a minute later they emerged empty-handed and mingled with the throng.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I wonder what he wants guts for," Tim said. "Don't say he eats them!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's smoke!" Craig exclaimed. "His hut's caught fire! Tim, quick, fetch a foam extinguisher from the overlander. Run!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Smoke, followed by licking flame, showed through Danger-field's window. It died, then sprang up again. Craig and Barney ran forward as Tim dashed for the overlander. The pygmies, some of whon^ were still quarreling over the pelts of the dead peke and bear, took no notice of them or the fire.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The interior of the hut was full of smoke. Flame crawled among the dry rushes on the floor. An oil lamp had been upset; it lay on its side among the flames. Only a few feet beyond it, Dangerfield sprawled on his bed, eyes closed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig pulled a rug from the other side of the room, flung it ' onto the fire, and stamped on it. When Tim arrived with the extinguisher, it was hardly needed, but they doused the smoldering ashes with chemicals to make doubly sure.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There might be an opportunity to talk to the old boy when he pulls out of his faint," Craig said. "Leave me here, will you, and I'll see what I can do."</p>

  <p class="block_17">As Tim and Barney left, Craig noticed the two bowls of entrails standing on a side table. They were still gently steaming.</p>

  <p class="block_17">On the bed, Dangerfield stirred. His eyelids flickered, and one frail hand went up to his throat.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No mercy from me," he muttered, "you'll get no mercy from me, you scum."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He lay looking up at the ecologist. Shadows crept like faded inkstains over his face.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I must have passed out," he said tonelessly. "Felt so weak."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You knocked over your oil lamp as you collapsed," Craig said. "I was just in time to save a bad blaze."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The old man made no comment, unless the closing of his eyes was to be interpreted as an indifference to death.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Every afternoon they bring me the bowls of entrails," he muttered. "It's a . . . rite. They're touchy about it. I wouldn't like to disappoint them. But this afternoon it was such an effort to stand. You people coming here exhausted me. If you aren't making a film, you'd better get "</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig fetched him a mug of water. He drank without raising his head, allowing half the liquid to trickle across his withered cheeks. Craig produced a hypodermic from his emergency pack and filled it from a plastic vial.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You're in pain," he said. "'This will stop the pain but leave your head clear. Let's have a look at your arm, can I?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dangerfield's eyes rested on the syringe as if fascinated. He began to shake slowly, until the rickety bed creaked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I don't need your help, mister," he said, his face crinkling.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We need yours," replied Craig indifferently, swabbing the thin, palsied arm. He nodded his head toward the bowls of entrails. "What are these unappetizing offerings? Some sort of religious tribute?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Unexpectedly, the old man began to laugh, his eyes filling with tears.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Perhaps it's to placate me," he said. "Every day for years, for longer than I can remember, they've been bringing me these guts. The pygmies must think I swallow them, and I don't like to disillusion them, in case—well, in case I lost my power over them."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He hid his gaunt, beaky face in his hands; the paper-thin skin on his forehead was suddenly showered with sweat. Craig steadied his arm, injected the needle deftly, and massaged the stringy flesh.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Standing away from the bed, he said deliberately, "It's strange that you stay here on Kakakakaxo when you fear these pygmies so much."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dangerfield looked sharply up, a scarecrow of a man with a shock of hair and sucked-in mouth. Staring at Craig, his eyes became very clear. He made no attempt to evade Craig's statement.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Everyone who goes into space has a good reason driving him," he said. "You don't only need escape velocity, you need a private dream—or a private nightmare." As always he spoke in Galingua, using it stiffly and unemphatically. "Me, I could never deal with people; you never know where you stand with them. I'd rather face death with the pygmies than life with humanity. There's a confession for you, Hodges, coming from Far-flung Father Dangerfield. Maybe all heroes are just escapists, if you could see into them."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You have it entirely wrong. Though it may be that all escapists pose as heroes," Craig said, but the old man continued to mutter to himself.</p>

  <p class="block_17">". . . so I stay on here, God of the Guts," he said. 'That's what I am, God of the Guts." His laugh wrecked itself on a shoal of wheezes.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He hunched himself up in the fetal position, breathing heavily. In a moment he was asleep. Craig sat still, integrating all he had learned or guessed about Dangerfield. At last he slipped the PES harness from his shoulders; unzipping a pouch, he extracted two specimen jars. He poured the bloody contents of the clay bowls into separate jars. Then he set down the bowls, covered the jars, and returned them to his pack.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And now, I think, a little helminthology," Craig said aloud.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As he returned through the village, he noticed that several pygmies lay, glaring unwinkingly at each other over the lacerated remains of the recent sacrifice. Circling them, he entered the overlander. It was unexpectedly good to breathe air free from the taint of fish and corruption.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Dangerfield's sleeping now," he announced to Barney and Tim. "I'll go back in a couple of hours to treat his 'fiffin' and get him in a talkative frame of mind. Let's eat."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How about exploring the temple in the cliff, Craig?" Tim asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We'll let it go till the morning. We don't want to upset the locals more than necessary—they might take offense at our barging in there. By morning I'm hoping Dangerfield will have given us more to go on."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Over the meal, Barney told Craig of two weaver birds that i he had snared while Craig was with Dangerfield.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The younger one had an unusually large number of lice on it," he said. "Not strange when you realize it's a bird living in a colony, and a youngster at that, not yet expert at preening. It goes to show that the usual complex ecological echelons are in full swing on Kakakakaxo."</p>

  <p class="block_17">With their meal, they drank some of Barney's excellent Aldebaran wine—only the wine of heavy-gravity planets will travel happily through space. As they lingered over coffee, Tim volunteered to go over and sit with Dangerfield.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Excellent idea," Craig agreed. "I'll be over to relieve you. And be careful—night's coming down fast."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Collecting his kit and a flashlight, Tim went out. Barney returned to his birds. Craig shut himself up in the tiny lab with his jars of entrails.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Cassivelaunus was sinking below the western horizon. Beneath the sheltering trees, darkness was already dominant; a fish scale gleamed here and there like a knife. In the treetops, where the weavers were settling to roost, an entanglement of light and shade moved. Kept apart by their tethers, peke and bear lay staring at each other in disconsolate pairs, indifferent to day and night. Hardly a cayman-head moved; joylessly they sprawled beneath their crude shelters, not sleeping, not watching.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Five of them lay in the open. These were the ones Craig had noticed earlier. They waited with their heads raised. In the gloom, only their yellow-white throats, where a pulse beat like a slow drum, were clearly distinguishable. As he made his way across the clearing, Tim saw that they were waiting around the bodies of the two creatures that had been sacrificed. They crouched tensely about the masses of battered fur, glaring at one another.</p>

  <p class="block_17">In Dangerfield's hut Tim found the oil lamp and a jar of fish oil with which to refill it. He trimmed the wick and lit it. Though it gave off a reek of fish, he preferred it to the glare of his solar flashlight.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dangerfield slept peacefully. Tim covered the old man with a blanket. In the chill air moving through the hut, Tim thought he caught a breath of the glaciers only a few hundred miles away, north or south.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Over him moved a feeling of wonder. He felt nothing of Craig's dislike of altering the nature of a planet, and was suddenly impatient for the morning, when they would integrate and interpret the riddles they glimpsed around them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A succession of leathery blows sounded outside. The three cayman-heads that crouched over one of the pelts were fighting. Though they were small, they battled like giants. Their main weapons were their long jaws, which they wielded as deftly as rapiers, parrying, thrusting, slashing, biting. When their jaws became wedged together in temporary deadlock, they used their claws as well. Each one fought against the other two.</p>

  <p class="block_17">After some minutes of this murderous activity, the three fell apart. Collapsing with their jaws along the ground, they eyed each other once more over the remains of the bear.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Later, the two pygmies crouching over the dead peke rose and did battle, their ferocious duel ending again with a sudden reversion into immobility. The deep, sullen evening light made the battles more terrible. However much the five pygmies suffered from wounds they received, they gave no sign of pain.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They are fighting over the gutted bodies of their slaves. It's a point of honor with them," Tim thought.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He turned from the window. Dangerfield had roused, awakened by the thumping outside. He spoke tiredly, without opening his eyes.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What are they fighting for?" Tim asked, lowering his voice.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Every sunset they fight in the same way."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What does it all mean?" Tim asked, but Dangerfield had drifted back into sleep.</p>

  <p class="block_17">After an hour, the old man became restless, throwing off his blanket and tearing open his shirt. Tossing on the bed, he clawed repeatedly at his chest, coughing and groaning.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Bending over him, Tim noticed a patch of discolored skin under one of the sick man's ribs. A red spot grew rapidly, lapping at the surrounding gray flesh. He made to touch it and then thought better of it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dangerfield groaned. Tim caught his wrist, steadying him against a crisis he did not understand. The patch on the chest formed a dark center like a storm cloud. It oozed, then erupted thick blood, which trailed around the cage of the ribs to soak into the blanket below. In the middle of the bloody crater, something moved.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A flat armored head appeared. A brown insect—it resembled a caterpillar larva—heaved itself into sight, to lie exhausted on the discolored flesh. Overcoming his disgust, Tim pulled a specimen jar from his pack and imprisoned the larva in it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I don't doubt that that's what Dangerfield calls a fiffin," he said. He forced himself to disinfect and dress the hermit's wound. He was bending over the bed when Craig came in to relieve him, carrying a tape recorder. Tim explained who had happened and staggered out into the open air.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Outside, in the darkness, the five cayman-heads still fought their intermittent battle. On every plane, Tim thought, endless, meaningless strife was continuing; strife and life—synonymous. He wanted to stop trembling.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The dead hour before the dawn: the time, on any planet in the universe, when the pulse of life falters before quickening. Craig entered the overlander with his tape recorder under one arm. Setting it down, he put coffee on the hot-point, rinsed his face with cold water, and roused the two sleepers.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We shall be busy today," he said, patting the recorder. "We now have plenty of data on Kakakakaxo to work on—^very dubious material, I might add. I recorded a long talk with Dangerfield, which I want you both to hear."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How is he?" Tim asked as he slipped on his tunic.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Physically, not in bad shape. Mentally, pretty sick. Suddenly he is chummy and communicative, then he's silent and hostile. An odd creature .... Not that you'd expect other than oddity after twenty years in this stagnation."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And the fiffin?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Dangerfield thinks it is the larval stage of a dung beetle,' and says they bore through anything. He has had them in his legs before, but this one only just missed his lungs. The pain must have been intense, poor fellow. I gave him a light hypalgesic and questioned him before its effect wore off."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney brought the boiling coffee off the stove and filled three beakers.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"All set to hear the playback," he said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig switched the recorder on. The reels turned slowly, recreating his voice and Dangerfield's.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Now that you are feeling better," Craig-on-tape said, "perhaps you could give me a few details about life on Kakakakaxo. How efficiently can these so-called pygmies communicate with each other?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">A silence followed before Dangerfield replied.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They're an old race, the pygmies," he said at length. "Their language has gradually worn down, like an old coin. I've picked up all I can in twenty-odd years, but you can take it from me that most of the time they're just making noises. Their language only expresses a few basic attitudes. Hostility. Fear. Hunger."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What about love?" Craig prompted.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They're very secretive about sex; I've never seen 'em mate, and you can't tell male from female. They just lay their eggs in the mud. . . . What was I saying? . . . Oh yes, about their manner of speech. You've got to remember,</p>

  <p class="block_17">Hodges, that I'm the only human—the only one—ever to master this clicking they do."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Have you been able to explain to them where you came from?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's a bit difficult for them to grasp. They've settled for 'beyond the ice.' "</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Meaning the glaciers to the north and south of the equatorial belt?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Yes; that's why they think I'm a god, because only gods can live beyond the ice. The pygmies know all about the glaciers. I've been able to construct a bit of their history from similar little items "</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That was one of the next things I was going to ask you about," Craig-on-tape said, as Barney-in-the-flesh handed around more coffee.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The pygmies are an ancient race," old Dangerfield said. "They've no written history, of course, but you can tell they're old by their knowing about the glaciers. How would equatorial creatures know about glaciers, unless their race survived the last Ice Age? Then this ornamented cliff in which many of them live—they could build nothing like that now. They haven't the skill. I had to help them put this hut up. Their ancestors must have been really clever; these contemporary generations are just decadent."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig's voice came skeptically from the loudspeaker: "We had an idea that the temple might have been built by another, vanished race. Any opinions on that?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You're on the wrong track, Hodges. The pygmies look on this temple as sacred; somewhere in the middle of it is what they refer to as 'the Tomb of the Old Kings,' and even / have never been allowed in there. They wouldn't behave like that if the place didn't have a special significance for them."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Do they still have kings?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No. They don't have any sort of rule now, except each man for himself. The five pygmies fighting outside the hut, for instance; there's nobody to stop them, so they'll go on until they are all dead."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Why should they fight over the pelts?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's a custom, that's all. They do it every night; sometimes one of them wins quickly, and then it's all over. They sacrifice their slaves in the day and squabble over their bodies at night."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Can you tell me why they attach such importance to these little animals—their slaves, as you call them?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Oh, they don't attach much importance to the slaves. It's just that they make a habit of catching them in the forest, since they regard the pekes and bears as a menace to them; their numbers have increased since I've been here."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Then why don't the pygmies kill them outright? And why do they always keep the two groups separate? Anything significant in that?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Why should there be? The pekes and bears are supposed to fight together if they are allowed to intermingle, but whether or not that's true I can't say. You mustn't expect | reasons for everything these pygmies do. They're not rational | the way a man is."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"As an ecologist, I find there is generally a reason for ;| everything, however obscure."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You do, do you?" The hermit's tone was belligerent. "In ' nineteen years here, I haven't found one. Look, it's no good staring at me with one eyebrow cocked. I don't like your superior ways, whether you're a good doctor or not."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You were saying the pygmies were not rational."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"True. They're living automatically on past glory. You can't do anything with 'em. I've tried. At least they acknowledged my authority. . . . It's a terrible thing to grow old. Look at my hands."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig reached forward and switched the recorder off. Outside, the first light penciled in the outlines of trees.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That's about all that's relevant," he said. "The rest of Dangerfield's remarks were mainly autobiographical."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What do you make of it, Craig?" Barney Brangwyn asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They heard the first weaver birds wake and cry in the trees as Craig replied.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Before Dangerfield crashed on Kakakakaxo, he was a salesman, hopping from one frontier planet to another. He was untrained as an observer."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I think you feel as I do," Barney said. "Dangerfield has misinterpreted just about everything he has seen. It's easy enough to do on a strange planet, even if you are emotionally balanced. Nothing in his statement can be trusted; it's useless, except perhaps as case history."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I wouldn't go so far as to say that," Craig remarked, with his usual caution. "It's untrustworthy, yes, but not useless."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Sorry, but I'm adrift," Tim Anderson said, getting up and pacing behind his chair. "Why should Dangerfield be so wrong? Most of what he said sounded logical enough to me. Even if he had no anthropological or ecological training to begin with, he's had plenty of time to learn."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"True, Tim, true," Craig agreed. "Plenty of time to learn correctly or learn wrongly. I'm not trying to pass judgment on Dangerfield, but there is hardly a fact in the universe not open to two or more interpretations. Dangerfield's attitude to the pygmies is highly ambivalent, a classical love-hate relationship. He wants to think of them as mere animals, because that would make them less formidable for him; at the same time, he wants to think of them as intelligent beings with a great past, because that makes their acceptance of him as their god more impressive."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And which are the pygmies, animals or intelligent beings?'" Tim asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"That is where our powers of observation and deduction come in," Craig said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tim was irritated. His companions could be very uninformative. He wanted to get away from them and think things over for himself. As he left, he remembered the jar he had put the fiffin larva into; he had forgotten to place it in the overlander's lab.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Two jars were already clipped in the rack above the lab bench. They contained two dead tapeworms; by the labels on the jars, he saw that Craig had extracted them from the entrails of the animals sacrificed the afternoon before. The cestodes, one of which came from the peke, one from the little bear, were identical: white tapes some twenty-four inches long, with suckers and hooks at the head end. Tim stared at them with interest before leaving the overlander.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Outside, dawn was seeping through the trees. He drew the cold air into his lungs; it was still flavored with fish. The weaver birds were beginning to call overhead. A few pygmies were about, moving sluggishly in the direction of the river. Tim stood there, shivering slightly in the cold, thinking of the oddity of two diverse species harboring the same sort of tapeworm.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The nightlong fight over the dead animals was ended. Of the five pygmies involved, only one remained alive; it lay with the gutted bear in its jaws, unable to move away. Three of its four legs had been bitten off. Tim's horror dissolved as he saw the whole situation sub specie aeternitads, with pain and death an inevitable concomitant of life; perhaps he was acquiring something of Craig's outlook.</p>

 <br>

  <p class="block_16">He picked up three of the dead pygmies, shouldered them, and, staggering slightly under their combined weight, carried them back to the overlander. He met Craig taking breakfast over to Dangerfield.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Hello," Craig exclaimed cordially. "What are you going to do with them?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I thought I'd do a little dissection," Tim said guardedly.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Once in the lab, he donned rubber gloves and slit open the pygmies' stomachs one by one, attending to nothing else. Removing the three intestinal sacs, he found that two of them were badly damaged by worms. Soon he had uncovered half a dozen roundworms, pink in coloration and still alive; they made vigorous attempts with their vestigial legs to climb from the crucible in which he placed them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He went excitedly in to Barney Brangwyn to report his findings. Barney was sitting at the table, manipulating metal rods.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This contradicts most of the laws of phylogeny," Tim said, peeling off his gloves. "According to Dangerfield, the pekes and bears are both recent arrivals on the evolutionary scene: yet their endoparasites, which Craig has preserved in the lab, are well adapted to their environment inside the creatures; in most respects they resemble the ancient order of tapeworm parasitic in man. The roundworms from the cayman-heads, on the other hand, bear all the marks of being recent arrivals. They are still something more than virtual egg factories, they retain traces of a previous, more independent existence—and they cause unnecessary damage to their host, always a sign that a suitable status quo has yet to ', be reached between host and parasite."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney raised his bushy eyebrows and smiled at the eager-' ness on Tim's face.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Very interesting indeed," he said. "What now, Doctor Anderson?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tim grinned, struck a pose, and said, in a creditable imitation of Craig's voice, "Always meditate upon all the evidence, and especially upon those things you do not realize are evidence."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Fair enough," Barney agreed, smiling. "And while you're meditating, come and give me a hand on the roof with this patent fishing rod I've made."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Another of your crazy ideas, Barney?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We're going hunting. Come on, your worms will keep!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Getting up, he produced a long, telescopic rod Tim recognized as one of their spare aerials. The last and smallest section was extended; to it Barney finished tying a sharp knife.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm still hankering to catch myself one of the local pets, without getting eaten at the same time," Barney said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Climbing up the stepped pole that led into the tiny radio room, he removed the circular observation dome that gave an all-around view of their surroundings. He swung himself up and onto the roof of the overlander. He crawled forward on hands and knees. Tim followed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Keep down," he muttered. "If possible, I'd like this act of folly to go unobserved."</p>

  <p class="block_17">A gigantic tree spread its boughs over them. They were well concealed. Cassivelaunus was breaking through a low cloud, and the clearing below was still fairly silent. Lying flat on his stomach, Barney pulled out the sections of aerial until he had a rod several yards long. Steadying this weapon with Tim's aid, he pushed it forward.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The end of it reached to the nearest pygmy shelter. Outside that shelter, two captive animals sat up, scratched, and watched with interest as the knife descended. Its blade hovered over the bear, shifted, and began rubbing gently back and forth across the thong that secured the animal.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The thong fell away. The bear was free. It scratched its yellow head in a parody of bewilderment. The neighboring peke clucked encouragingly at it. A procession of pygmies appeared among the trees. Hearing them, the bear was spurred into action.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Grasping the aerial in its little black hands, the bear swarmed nimbly up. It jumped onto the overlander roof and faced the men, without showing fear.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney retracted the aerial. This maneuver was glimpsed by the returning pygmies. They began to clack and growl. Other pygmies emerged from their shelters, scuttling toward the overlander and staring up.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The cayman-heads emerging from the forest wore the look of tired hunters, returning with the dawn. Over their shoulders, roughly tied, lay freshly captured bears or pekes. These pygmies unceremoniously dropped their burdens and scuttled at a ferocious pace to the PES vehicle.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Alarmed by the commotion, the weavers poured from their treetop homes, screeching.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Let's get in," Barney said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Picking up the bear, which offered no resistance, he jumped down inside the overlander.</p>

  <p class="block_17">At first, the creature was overcome by its surroundings. It stood on the table and rocked piteously from side to side. Recovering, it accepted milk and chattered to the two men. Seen close, it bore little resemblance to a bear, except for its fur covering. It stood upright as the cayman-heads did, attempting to smooth its bedraggled fur with its fingers. When Tim proffered his pocket comb, it used that gratefully, wrenching diligently at the knots in its long coat, which was still wet with dew.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Well, it's male, it's intelligent, and it's more fetching than its overlords," commented Tim. "You have what you wanted, but the wolves are at the door, howling for our blood."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Through the window, Barney saw that the pygmies surrounded the overlander in ever-growing numbers, waving their claws, snapping their jaws. In the blue light they looked at once repulsive, comic, and malign.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Evidently we have offended against a local law of property. Until they cool down, Craig's return is blocked; he'll have to tolerate Daddy Dangerfield for a while."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tim did not reply; before Craig returned, there was something else he wished to do. But first he had to get away from the overlander.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He stood uncertainly, and then Barney turned his attention again to his new pet. Tim quickly climbed up into the radio nest unobserved, opened the dome, and stood once more on the roof of the overlander. Catching hold of an overhanging bough of the big tree, he pulled himself into it; working his way along, screened from the clacking mob below, he got well away from them before dropping down from a lower branch on to clear ground. Then he walked briskly in the direction of the cliff temple.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Dangerfield switched the projector off. As the colors died, he turned eagerly to Craig Hodges.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There!" he exclaimed, with pride. "What do you think of that?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Though his chest was still bandaged, the hermit moved easily. Modern healing treatments had speeded his recovery; he looked ten years younger than the old man who had yesterday suffered from fifiins. The excitement of the film he had just been showing had brought a flush to his cheeks.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Well, what do you think of it?" he repeated, impatiently.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Tm wondering what you think of it," Craig said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Some of the animation left Dangerfield. He looked around the stuffy confines of his hut, as if seeking a weapon.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You've no respect," he said. "I took you for a civilized man, Hodges. But you persist in trying to insult me in underhanded ways. Even the Droxy film men recognized me for what I am."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You mean for what you like to think you are," Craig said. Dangerfield swung a heavy stick. Craig brought up his arm, and the blow landed close to his elbow. He seized the stick, wrenching it from Dangerfield's grasp and tossing it out of the door.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The two men stood confronting each other. Dangerfield's gaze wavered, and he turned away. Craig left the hut.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He walked briskly across the clearing toward the cayman-heads. As he drew nearer, part of the rabble detached itself from the overlander and moved toward him, jaws creaking open. Without slackening his stride, he pushed between their scaly green bodies. The cayman-heads merely croaked excitedly as Craig passed. Jostling, shuffling their paws in the dirt, they let him get by. He mounted the step of the overlander and entered unmolested.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig read something of the relief and admiration on Barney's face.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They must have guessed how stringy I'd taste," he remarked. That was all that was said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He turned his attention to Barney's bear-creature, already christened Fido. The animal chattered perkily as Barney explained how he got it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'll swear Fido has some sort of embryo language," Barney said. "In exchange for a good rubdown with insecticide, he has let me examine his mouth and throat. He's well enough equipped for speech."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Show him how to use a pencil and paper, and see what he makes of it," Craig suggested, stroking the creature's yellow crest.</p>

  <p class="block_17">As Barney did so, he asked Craig what had kept him so long with Dangerfield.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I was beginning to think the lost race of Kakakakaxo had got you," he said, grinning.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No. He has been showing me a film intended to impress me with the greatness of Dangerfield."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"A documentary?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Anything but! A squalid film made by Melmoth Studios on Droxy, supposedly based on the old boy's life. They presented him with a copy of it and a projector as a souvenir. It's called 'Curse of the Crocodile Men.' "</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Ye Gods!" Barney exclaimed. "I mustn't miss that when it's on circuit again! I'll bet you found it instructive."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"In many ways. The script writers and director spent two days—^just two days!—here on Kakakakaxo, talking to Dangerfield and 'soaking up atmosphere,' before returning to Droxy to cook up their own ideas on the subject. No other research was done."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney laughed briefly. "Who gets the girl?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There is a girl, of course, and Dangerfield gets her. She's a coy blonde stowaway on his spaceship. You know."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I know. Now tell me why you found it instructive."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It was all oddly familiar. After the usual preliminaries—a spectacular spaceship crash on a plastic mountainside, et cetera —a Tarzanlike Dangerfield is shown being captured by the bear-race, who stand six feet high and wear tin helmets, so help me. Dangerfield could not escape because the blonde twisted her ankle in the crash. You know how blondes are in films.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The pekes, for simplicity's sake, never appear. The bears are torturing our hero and heroine to death when the crocodile men raid the place and rescue him. The crocodile men are Melmoth's idea of our cayman-headed pals outside."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Stop giving me the trailer," Barney said, feigning suspense. "Get on with the plot. I want to know how the blonde makes out."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The crocodile men arrive in time to save her from a fate</p>

  <p class="block_17">worse than a sprained ankle. And here's an interesting point—^f these crocodile men, according to the film, are a proud and ancient warrior race, come down in the world through the encroachment of the jungle. When they get Dangerfield back to their village by the river, they don't like him. They, too, are about to put him to death and ravage the blonde when he saves the leader's son from foot-rot or something. From then on the tribe treats him like a god, builds him a palace, and all the rest of it."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"To think I missed it! It sounds like a real classic!" Barney cried. "Perhaps we can get Dangerfield to give a matinee tomorrow. I can see how such a bit of personal aggrandizement would be dear to his heart."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It was very sad stuff," Craig said. "Nothing rang true. False dialogue, fake settings. Even the blonde wasn't very attractive."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney sat silent for a minute, looking rather puzzledly into space, tweaking his beard. "It's odd that, considering this hokum was cooked up on Droxy, it tallies surprisingly well in outline with what Dangerfield told you last night about the great past of the cayman-heads, their decline, and so on."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Exactly!" Craig agreed with satisfaction. "Don't you see what that means, Barney? Nearly everything Dangerfield knows, or believes he knows, comes from a hack film shot in a Droxy studio, rather than vice versa."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They stared at one another with growing amusement. Into both their minds came the reflection that all human behavior is ultimately inexplicable; even the explicable is a mystery.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Now you see why he shied away from us so violently at our first meeting," Craig said. "He's got almost no firsthand information on conditions here. He's been afraid to go out looking for it. Knowing that, he was prepared to face Droxy film people—who would only be after a good story—but not scientists, who would want hard facts. Once I had him cornered, of course, he had to come out with what little he'd got, presumably hoping we would swallow it as the truth and go."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney made clucking noises. "He's probably no longer fit to remember what is truth, what lies. After nineteen years, the old boy must be quietly crazy."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Fear has worked steadily on Dangerfield all this time. He's afraid of people, afraid of the cayman-heads, the crocodile men. He takes refuge from his terrors in fantasy. He's become a film god. And you couldn't budge him off the planet because he realizes, subconsciously of course, that reality would then catch up with him. He has no choice but to remain here, in a place he loathes."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Okay, doctor," he said. "Diagnosis accepted. Brilliant field work—my congratulations. But, all we have collected so far are phantoms. Tell me where PES work stands after you've proved the uselessness of our main witness—presumably, at a standstill?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"By no means," Craig said. He pointed to Fido. The little bear was sitting on the table cuddling the pencil.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He had drawn a crude picture on the paper. It depicted a room in which a bear and a peke were locked in each other's arms, as if fighting.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A few minutes later, when Craig had gone into the laboratory with an assortment of coleoptera and anoplura culled from Dangerfield's hut, Barney saw the old hermit himself coming across to them, hobbling rapidly among the pygmy shelters with the aid of a stick. Barney called to Craig.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig emerged from the lab looking at once pleased and secretive.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Those three pygmy carcasses Tim brought into the lab," he said. "I presume Tim cut them up—it doesn't look like your work. Did he say anything to you about them?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney explained the point Tim had made about the roundworms.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Is there anything wrong?" he inquired.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"No, nothing, nothing," Craig said, shaking his head. "And that's all Tim said Where is he now, by the way?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I've no idea! The boy's getting as secretive as you. He must have gone outside for a breath of fish. Shall I give him a call?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Let's tackle Dangerfield first," Craig said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They opened the door. Most of the cayman-heads had dispersed. The old man refused to come into the overlander, his nose standing out from his head like a parrot's beak as he shook his head. He wagged a finger angrily at them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I always knew no good would come of your prying," he said. "Now that young fellow of yours is being killed by the pygmies—serves him right, too. But goodness knows what they'll do when they've tasted human flesh—tear us all apart, I shouldn't wonder. I doubt if I'll be able to stop them."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He had not finished talking before Craig and Barney had leaped from the overlander.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Where's Tim? What's happened to him?" Craig asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I expect it'll be too late by now," said Dangerfield. "I saw him slip into the cliff temple, the young fool. Now perhaps—“</p>

  <p class="block_17">But the PES men were already running across the clearing, scattering brilliant birds about their heads. They jumped the shelters in their path. As they neared the temple, they heard the clacking of the cayman-head pack. When they reached the heavily ornamented doorway, they saw a tight crowd of the creatures, all fighting to get into the cliff. "Tim!" bawled Barney. "Tim! Are you there?" No answer came. The pack continued struggling to get into the temple.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We can't massacre this lot," Craig said, glaring at the cayman-heads before them. "How're we going to get in there to Tim?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We can use the cry gas in the overlander!" Barney said. "That will shift them." He doubled back to their vehicle and in a minute brought it bumping across the clearing. The roof of the overlander snagged several branches, breaking the weavers' carefully constructed roof and sending angry birds flying in all directions. As the vehicle lumbered up, Craig unstrapped an outside container and pulled out a hose; the other end of it was already connected to internal gas tanks. Barney threw down two respirators and put one on himself.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Donning his mask, Craig slung the spare over his arm and charged forward with the hose. The gas poured over the nearest cayman-heads, who fell back like magic, coughing and pawing at their goat-yellow eyes. The two men entered the temple; they moved down the corridor past bodies fighting to get out of their way. The croaking was deafening; in the dark and mist, Craig and Barney could hardly see ahead.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The corridor changed into a pygmy-sized tunnel, running upward through the mountain. The two ecologists had to struggle every foot of the way, and then</p>

  <p class="block_17">The supply of cry gas gave out. Craig and Barney stopped, peering at each other in shock.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I thought the gas tanks were full?" Craig asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They were. Maybe one of the cayman-heads bit through the hose."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Their retreat was cut off: the cayman-heads at the mouth of the temple would have recovered by now, and be waiting for them. So they moved ahead, throwing off their respirators and pulling out blasters.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They turned a comer and stopped. This was the end of the passageway. The tunnel broadened into a sort of anteroom, on the far side of which stood a wide wooden door. A group of cayman-heads were scratching at it; they turned and confronted the men. Tears stood in their eyes: a whiff of the gas had reached them, and served only to anger them. Six of them were there. They charged.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Get 'em!" Barney yelled.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The dim chamber twitched with blinding blue-white light. But the best hand weapon has its limitations, and the cayman-heads had speed on their side.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney scarcely had time to dispatch one of them, and then another landed squarely on him. For a small creature, it was unbelievably powerful. He fell backward, bellowing, as the jaws gaped up to his face. He tried to writhe away as he fired the blaster against a leathery stomach. The creature fell from him, and in a dying kick knocked the weapon from his hand.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Before Barney could retrieve his blaster, two more cayman-heads landed on him, sending him sprawling. He was defense-less against their claws.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Blue light leaped and crackled over him. An intolerable heat breathed above his cheek. The two cayman-heads rolled over beside him, their bodies black and charred. Shakily, Barney stood up.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The wooden door had been flung open. Tim stood there, bolstering the blaster that had saved Barney's life.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig had settled his attackers. They lay smoldering on the floor in front of him. He stood now, breathing deeply, his tunic sleeve torn. The three men looked at each other, grimy and disheveled. Craig was the first to speak.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Close... too close," he muttered.</p>

  <p class="block_17">“I thought we'd had it then; thanks for the helping hand, Tim," Barney said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">His beard had been singed, its edges turned a dusty brown. He felt his cheek tenderly where a blister was already forming. Sweat poured from him; the heat from the thermonuclear blasts had sent the temperature in the anteroom soaring.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I'm sorry you came in after me," Tim said, "I was safe enough behind this door. I've been doing a little research on my own, Craig—you'd better come in and see this place for yourself, now that you're here. I have discovered the Tomb of the Old Kings that Dangerfield told us about! You'll find it explains quite a lot we did not know."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"How did you manage to get as far as this without the cayman-heads stopping you?" Craig asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Most of them were clustered around the overlander calling for Barney's blood when I entered. They only started creeping up on me when I was actually inside."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They entered the inner room. Tim barred the door before shining his flashlight down the long room. Its builders had known what they were doing. Decoration was kept to a minimum, except for the elaborate door arch and the restrained fan vaulting of the ceiling. Attention was focused on a large catafalque, upon which lay a row of sarcophagi. Everything i was deep in dust, and the air was musty.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tim pointed to the line of little coffins, which were embellished with carvings.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Here are the remains of the Old Kings of Kakakakaxo," he said. "And although I may have made myself a nuisance, I think I can claim that with their aid I have solved the mystery of the lost race of this planet. It's like a jigsaw puzzle. We already had most of the pieces. Dangerfield supplied nearly all of them—but the old boy had fitted them together upside down. You see, to start with, there is not one lost race, but two."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"A nice buildup, Tim. Now let's have some facts," Craig said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You can have facts. I'm showing them to you. This temple —and doubtless others like it all over the planet—was hewn out of the rock by two races who have engraved their own likenesses on these sarcophagi. Take a look at them! Far from being lost, the races have been under our noses all the time: they are the beings we call the pekes and bears. Their portraits are on the sarcophagi, and their remains lie inside. Their resemblance to Droxian animals has blinded us to what they really are—the ancient top dogs of Kakakakaxo!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I’m not surprised," Barney said, turning from an inspection of the stone coffins. "The bear people are brighter than the cayman-heads. As I see it, the caymans are pretty stodgy reptiles whom nature has endowed with armor but precious little else. I had already decided that that was another thing Great God Dangerfield had garbled: far from being an ancient race, the caymans are neoteric, upstart usurpers who have only recently appeared to oust the peke and bear people.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Dangerfield said they know about the glaciers. They probably drifted down from the cold regions until the river brought them to these equatorial lands. As for the bear people—and I suspect the same goes for the pekes—their chatter, far from being the beginning of a language, is the decadent tail end of one. They were the ancient races, already in decline when the parvenu pygmies descended on them and completed their disintegration."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The helminthological evidence supports this theory," Tim said eagerly. He turned to Craig. "The cayman-heads are too recent to have developed their own peculiar cestodes; they were almost as much harmed by interior parasites, the roundworms, as was Daddy by his fiffin. In a long-established host-parasite relationship, the amount of internal damage is minimal."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"As was the case with the peke and bear cestodes I uncovered," Craig agreed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"As soon as I saw these roundworms, I realized that Dangerfield's claim that the pygmies were the ancient species and their 'pets' the new might be the very reverse of the truth. I came over here hoping to find proof: and here it is."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It was a good idea, Tim," Barney said heartily, "but you shouldn't have done it alone—far too risky."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The habit of secretiveness is catching," Tim said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He looked at Craig, but the chief ecologist seemed not to have heard the remark. He marched to the door and put an ear to it. Barney and Tim listened, too. The noise was faint at first, then became unmistakable—a chorus of guttural grunts and croaks. The cry gas had dispersed. The pygmies were pressing back into the temple.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The noise took on weight and volume. It rose to a climax as claws struck the outside of the door. Craig stood back. The door shook.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This is not a very healthy place," Craig said, turning back to the others. "Is there another way out?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">They moved down the long room. Its walls were blank. Behind them, the door rattled and groaned. At the far end of the chamber stood a screen; there was a narrow door behind it. Barney pushed the screen away and with one thrust of his great shoulders sent the door shattering back. Rusted hinges and lock left a bitter, red powder floating in the air. Climbing over the door, they found themselves in a steep and narrow tunnel, where they were forced to go in single file.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I should hate to be caught in here," Tim said. "Do you think the cayman-heads will dare enter the tomb room? They seem to regard it as sacred."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Their blood's up. A superstition may not bother them," said Barney.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What I still don't understand," Tim said, "is why the cayman-heads care so much for the temple if it has nothing to do with them."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You probably never will," Craig said. "The temple may be for them a symbol of their new dominance, and one man's symbol is another man's enigma. I can hear that door splintering; let's get up this tunnel. It must lead somewhere."</p>

  <p class="block_17">One behind the other, they literally crawled along the shaft. It bore steadily upward at an angle of forty-five degrees. On all sides, the mountain made its presence felt, dwarfing them, threatening to engulf them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They had climbed some distance when Barney stopped.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The way's blocked!" he exclaimed.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The tunnel was neatly stoppered with a solid substance. Rock fall!" he cried.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"We can't use a blaster on it in this space," Tim said, "or we'll cook ourselves."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig passed a knife forward.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Try the blockage with this," he said, "and see what it's made of."</p>

  <p class="block_17">The substance flaked reluctantly as Barney scraped. They examined the flakes; Tim recognized them first.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"This is guano—probably from bats!" he exclaimed. "WC: must be very near the surface. Thank goodness for that!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It's certainly guano," Craig agreed, "but it's almost as hard as stone with age. You can see that a limestone shell has formed over the bottom of it: it may be hundreds of years old. There may be many feet of guano between us and the surface."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Then we'll have to dig through it," Barney said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">There was no alternative. The ill-smelling guano became softer as they dug upward, until it reached the consistency of moist cake. They rolled lumps of it back between their knees, sending it bounding back, down into the mountain. It clung stickily to them, like paste.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Twenty-five feet of solid guano had to be tunneled through before they struck air. Barney's head and shoulders emerged into a small cave. A six-legged, doglike creature backed growling into the open and fled. It had taken over the cave for a lair long after the bats had deserted it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">The others followed Barney out, to stand blinking in the intense blue light. They were plastered with filth. Without speaking, they left the cave and drew in lungfuls of fresh air.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Trees and bushes surrounded them. The ground sloped steeply down to the left. When they had recovered, they began to descend in that direction. They were high up the mountainside; Cassivelaunus gleamed through the leaves above them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There's nothing else to keep us on Kakakakaxo," Barney said. "Dangerfield will be glad to see the back of us. I wonder how he'll like the colonists? They'll come flocking in once HQ gets our clearance. They'll find some opposition, but there's nothing here the biggest fool can't handle."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Except Dangerfield," Craig interjected.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"The man with the permanent wrong end of the stick!" Tim added, laughing. "He will see out his days selling signed picture postcards of himself to colonists and tourists."</p>

  <p class="block_17">They emerged from the trees. Before them was a cliff, steep and bush-studded. The ecologists went to its edge and looked down.</p>

  <p class="block_17">A fine panorama stretched out before them. In the distance, a range of snow-covered mountains seemed to hang suspended in the blue air. Nearer, winding between stretches of jungle, ran the cold river. On its banks, the ecologists could see cayman-heads basking in the sun; in the water, others swam and dived.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Look at them!" Craig exclaimed. "They are really aquatic creatures. They've hardly had time to adapt to land life. The dominating factor of their lives remains—fish!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"They've already forgotten us," Barney said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">They could see that the crude settlement was deserted. The overlander was discernible through trees, but it took them an hour of scrambling down hazardous paths before they reached it.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Craig went around to look at the severed cry gas hose. It bad been neatly chopped, as if by a knife. This was Danger-field's work—he had expected to trap them in the temple! There was no sign of the old man anywhere. Except for the melancholy captives, sitting at the end of their tethers, the clearing was deserted.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Before we go, I"m setting these creatures free,"' Barney said.</p>

  <p class="block_17">He ran among the shelters, slashing at the thongs with a knife, liberating pekes and bears. As they found themselves free, they banded together and trotted off into the jungle without further ado.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Two more generations," Barney said regretfully, "and there probably won't be a bear or a peke on Kakakakaxo alive outside a zoo; the colonists will make shorter work of them than the cayman-heads have. As for the cayman-heads, I don't doubt they'll only survive by taking to the rivers again."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"There's another contradiction," Tim remarked thoughtfully, as they climbed into the overlander and Barney backed her through the trees. "Dangerfield said the peke and bear people fought with each other if they had the chance, yet they went off peacefully enough together—and they ruled together once, as the tomb proves. Where does the fighting come in?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"As you say, Dangerfield always managed to grab the wrong end of the stick," Craig answered. "If you take the opposite of what he told us, that's likely to be the truth. He has always been too afraid of his subjects to go out and look for the truth."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney laughed. "Here it comes," he said. "I warn you, Tim, the oracle is about to speak! In some ways you're very transparent, Craig; I've known ever since we left the tomb of the old kings that you had something up your sleeve and were waiting for an appropriate moment before you produced it."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"What is it, Craig?" Tim asked curiously.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney let Fido out of the overlander; the little creature ran off across the clearing without a backward glance.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"You were careless when you cut open those three pygmies in the lab, Tim," Criag said. "I know that you were looking for something else, but if you had been less excited, you would</p>

  <p class="block_17">have observed that the cayman-heads are parthenogenic. They have only one sex, reproducing by means of self-fertilized eggs."</p>

  <p class="block_17">"I see. Does this make any difference to the situation?'" Tim asked.</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney smote his forehead in savage surprise.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Ah, I should have seen it myself! Parthenogenic, of course! Self-fertilizing! It explains the lack of vanity or sexual inhibition we noticed. I swear I would have hit on the answer myself, if I hadn't been so occupied with Fido."</p>

  <p class="block_17">He climbed heavily into the driver's seat, slamming the door. The air conditioning sucked away the invading smell of fish at once.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Yes, you have an interesting situation on Kakakakaxo," Craig continued. "Try and think how difficult it would be for such a parthenogenic species to visualize a bisexual species like man. Nevertheless, the cayman-heads grasped one weakness iiAerent in the bisexual system: if you keep the two sexes apart, the raap cannot breed and dies out.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"And that is just what they were doing—separating male and female. That is how they manage to hold this place. Of course, no scheme is perfect, and quite a few of both sexes escaped into the forest to breed."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Barney revved the engine, moving the overlander forward and leaving Tim to ask the obvious question.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"Yes," Craig said. "As Fido tried to explain to us with his drawing, the 'bears' are the males and the 'pekes' the females of one species.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It just happens to be a dimorphous species, the sexes varying in size and configuration, or we would have guessed the truth at once. The cayman-heads, in their dim way, knew. They tackled the whole business of conquest in a way only a parthenogenic race would—they segregated the sexes."</p>

  <p class="block_17">Tim whistled.</p>

  <p class="block_17">"So when Dangerfield thought the pekes and bears were fighting," he said, "they were really copulating! And of course the similar cestodes you found in their entrails would have put you on the right track; I ought to have guessed it myself!"</p>

  <p class="block_17">"It must be odd to play god in a world about which you really know or care so little," Barney commented, swinging the vehicle down the track in the direction of their space ship. "I wonder if the Creator is as indifferent to us?"</p>

  <p class="block_17">The old man hid behind a tree, watching the overlander leave. He shook his head, braced himself, hobbled back to his hut. His servants would have to hunt in the jungles before he got today's offering of entrails. He shivered as he thought of those two symbolic and steaming bowls. He shivered for a long time. He was old; from the sky he had come; to the sky he would one day return. But before that, he was going to tell ever&gt;'one what he really thought of them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">How he despised them.</p>

  <p class="block_17">How he needed them.</p>
